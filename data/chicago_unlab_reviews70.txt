i have stayed at this property several times , the hotel is located in south chicago area , at the convention center . staff was friendly . i asked for , and was given a room with a city view , up high . the room i had was handicap-able , so i think it was a bit different the the rest . the elevators were fast and efficient , the property was clean . N computers are offered in the lobby to print airline documents . the internet in rooms was slow , but useful . not certain if i will be charged for it or not ? my only negative is that there are no in room safes . i called and was told that i could keep my valuables in the safe behind the front desk ? ? odd for a hotel ? ? who wants to wait in a lines to access cash , or personal property ? the red line subway is about a N block walk , safe by day . check out the shark chicken fish takeout restaurant close by , great catfish ! ! 
it ' s conveniently located right next to one of the theaters that ' s playing wicked . so the eccentrically decorated room i had was a bit smaller than it appeared on the hotel site ' s photos . my room did not have a great view , it ' s facing other tall buildings , but it was quiet . it does have modern amenitiy like the flat screen tv , very comfortable bed , toiletries from aveda , and an alarm clock radio that you can hook up your ipod to . the downside is i had trouble finding an outlet to plug my laptop and charge my phone . the closet is very small . this hotel has been around for a while even with it ' s modern amenities , but for some reason i just got the creeps especially when someone told me the hotel was part of the haunted tour . . i didn ' t see anything unusual . overall , it ' s not too shabby . 
every moment of our stay here was wonderful . . . . the staff is very welcoming and helpful , the hotel in every detail is beautiful . . . we loved our stay here ! they have a complimentary driver who will take you anywhere in the city you would like to go , which is a real treat ! the rooms that we had adjoined and were very spacious ( one had a fireplace ) and the bathrooms were gorgeous no detail has been overlooked ! we also used the workout area which is also very well done with great equipment . thank you , elysian for coming to chicago and giving us a world class place to stay . . . we will definately come back . 
this hotel is not really my style . it is very contemporary , but the beds are so very comfortable . . . . so that ' s great . the " living room " about blew my teen kids away . they think that it ' s the bomb . what i have loved so far . . . . . chris the guy out front who helped us bring up our bags . he ' s awesome and friendly . . . . made friends with my son and even called us to tell my son that they were filming the new batman downstairs and that he should come down and watch the filming . that was cool . we got to see " gotham " police dept . cars on the street . apparently , they ' ll be filming all night . i also forgot my computer power cable and jeff , the concierge , called around and helped me find one . that was a godsend . i ' m working on my master ' s thesis and really would have been in bad shape without it . all in all , this is not a great shopping destination hotel , but we ' re easy walking distance to lollapalooza and thus the art museum and theatre district . very comfortable . very nice . p . s . thanks w staff . you ' ve made this a nice experience . 
so many positive reviews of this hotel from people who have never before contributed to tripadvisor ? you can t help but wonder if they re written by never-stay college students for N a pop . so is the elysian that good ? frankly , after our may stay , i would travel back to chicago from australia just to revisit this hotel . we still reminisce about our N night stay at the elysian - a nostalgic conversation prompted this review . fantastic location . despite the rigorous no-tipping policy , the service is extraordinary consistently uber-friendly , helpful and efficient . door staff offer umbrellas at the suggestion of rain , jump to provide the free hotel town car service whenever possible . restaurant staff , noting the presence of a noisy group of diners , quickly offer a table in a quiet corner . the spa delivered the best pedicure of my life . gym staff offer evian water as you rack up your treadmill miles . our premier gold coast suite was subtle and gorgeous , with excellent flat screen tvs , cosy fire-place , fabulous wardrobe space and gi-normous marble bathroom only suggestion for improvement would be outdoor furniture on the terrace . housekeeping was perfect , the bathroom always squeaky clean . great free wi-fi . room service menu was a bit minimalist for my taste . after a delectable mexican dinner at salpicon and hilarity at second city , we stopped by the hotel bar for a night-cap . snug , elegant , romantically dim , with generous yet non-intrusive service we enjoyed excellent cocktails at bernard s bar . ( the next day i unsuccessfully tried to discover the ingredients of mine on the internet i think it contained lavender ? ) absolutely recommend this hotel ! 
i made my reservation at the whitehall hotel on expedia . com . when i arrived , cecelia at the front desk informed me that they had not received any notice of the reservation from expedia . i placed a call and the representative at expedia kept me waiting nearly an hour before he was able to determine that an error in their computer system was causing the e-faxed reservation confirmations to not be sent properly to hotels . cecelia was very patient and helpful . she also upgraded us to a beautiful suite even though the hotel was not at fault . she is a wonderful example of what hospitality really means and i will definitely be returning to the whitehall . 
my fiancee and i booked a room at the knickerbocker and just returned . we had room N , which had a king size bed and a partial view of the beach . this hotel is not as bad as people on this website say it is . i was concerned after reading some reviews , but when we arrived i realized that some people are just way too picky . i didn ' t feel the hotel was " disgusting " as some other reviewers thought . here are some highlights room - the room was decent sized and had a very comfortable king size bed . the decorations are a little weird , but i feel like it adds to the character of this hotel . the bathroom is small , but for one person at a time it is fine . the shower worked really nice and the soaps and shampoos included were good quality . considering how old the hotel is , i feel the rooms are in very good condition . lobby - the lobby is large with a really nice bar attached . the drinks were pricey though at about N for a rum and coke . we didn ' t go to the hotel restaurant , but it looked like it is very reasonably priced . staff - the front desk staff , concierge , and bell hops were all very friendly and accommodating . the concierge even helped us find the address for a bar we were looking for . we had no problems at all . location - absolutely perfect . less than one block from michigan avenue and the hancock building and only about two blocks from water tower place . it is close to the beach too . also , tons of restaurants were within walking distance , including ditka ' s . parking - we parked directly across the street at the parking garage right next to the drake . they charged N per day , but it ' s better than the N per day that the hotel charges . overall , we had a great stay at the knickerbocker and we would stay there again . 
at about N night for N people ( breakfast included ) , this was undeniably an excellent deal . the location is prime , and the room was well-designed and comfortably held our entire family . the free cocktail each evening was nice the nibbles were decent ( an unfortunate sea of styrofoam cups , however ) . however , the much vaunted " cooked to order breakfast " was a chaotic , unpleasant ordeal each morning . we felt like cattle waiting to be served at the trough . there was insufficient seating , and the entire environment reeked of make-shift disposable ( ugly folding tables chairs , ugly plastic trays , and again a miserable waste of styrofoam cups ) . dread of the breakfast pandemonium would cause hesitation in whether to stay at this hotel again . it is a shame , as so much of the hotel has good things to offer . 
unless you don ' t care about service , it is non-existent behind the front desk . i was staying at the hotel felix with my wife and N kids . " can i have adjoining rooms ? " " no sir they are all accounted for . " " ok , can i have a room w two double beds that are near my room ? " " no sir , they are all accounted for . " " i am traveling with N kids , what would you like me to do ? " no reply . all rooms that were left for us were one queen bed and no adjoining rooms . meanwhile it was N pm and this was a very early check in . at this point we decided we could not stay and sat on the couch to discuss our next move . after another few minutes a woman who was also behind the front desk walked over to us and whispered , " i got you a king bed in one room and a queen in another and they are adjoining " " wonderful , we will take it ! ! " the rooms were very clean and small , but that is to be expected in a boutique hotel . when we put the air conditioning on in one of the rooms it made a noise so loud that we couldn ' t hear our tv in the second room . we called down and a maintenance man was sent up . he said the problem was the condenser and there was not much he could do . he spent about N minutes in our room but could not fix it . he left and said he would be back in a few minutes . he came back and said that he could try to reset the unti . he spent another N N hour with us and reset the unit to no avail . " sorry , nothing we can do , but we could switch your room " obviously not , it took long enough to get adjoining rooms . " so the unit cannot be fixed ? " " nope , but i can give you a free movie " great , i have an air conditioner that is so loud that i can ' t hear the tv and for that inconvenience i can have a free movie that i won ' t be able to hear . great ! so my child decides to watch avatar . he blasts the tv in his room and then it is time to go to dinner so he needs to pause the tv . we go to dinner and then come back to the room and he tries to watch his movie again . cannot find it anywhere to resume play . so , the hotel sends up the same maintenance guy . he spends another N N hour with us to try to resume the movie . he cant figure it out . " you will just have to order it again " " ok , will that be complimentary ? " " no , you will have to pay for that " thats all i got . had a fantastic weekend in chicago . stay there all the time . have never had such poor service , which is very surprising giving the amount of competition that exists . 
i loved this hotel . i first stayed in hotel indigo in atlanta , ga , and loved it so i figured i ' d give it another shot . this one did not disappoint . the location is a bit far from downtown , but you ' re right by the l , so it ' s really not bad . the beds are amazingly comfortable , the decor is bright and fresh , the rooms are fairly spacious ( although a small bathroom ) . the service was ok . they were not rude at all , but no overly nice either . i would definitely stay in this hotel again if i were headed back to chicago . ) 
we stayed here for the following reasons N . free chicago parking N . free shuttle to train station at midway N . points per night were N , N on starwood the employees were extremely friendly and cooperative , the shuttle drivers and front desk bent over backwards to give you anything you needed . my basic complaint with the property is that it needs a good makeover . double beds in two bedded rooms are too small for this man and his wife , " we got little or no sleep " . not that we shouldn ' t lose at least N pounds between the two of us , but i do prefer queen beds in two bedded rooms . the room itself was tidy , but needed updating . certainly nothing to keep me away from it . the hvac system was noisy and did not keep the temperature very steady , we spent the night either too hot or too cold -- very little sleep for either of us . the tv didn ' t work most of the time we were there , we would have moved rooms but weren ' t in the room enough to bother with that . two free computers and printers in the lobby to use for guests were very convenient . parking is free here , so we were able to leave our car and use public transportation to get around town at N for a two day transit pass . shuttle service was near immediate every time we needed it . they gave us a number to call when we were approaching the train station to let them know you needed picked up . 
we stayed N nights and were extremely pleased with the accommodations and service we received . we were able to check in N Nam which was a relief ( reg checkin was Npm ) . rooms were fantastic and we were given a great view of the city overlooking the riverwalk . fitness center is great also . one disappointment no pool jacuzzi . 
absolutely awesome hotel ! i had the pleasure at staying at this hotel on short notice . the staff , specifically ms . jackie , and ms . regina provided great service . i flew in from washington , d . c . and my family failed to find a place for me to stay . cslh found a way to help me at the most difficult time . once i got to my room , everything was well laid out , the room was very clean , and you the climate , as well as the freshness of the room was very nice . the attitude of every member of the staff was very friendly and professional . i will certainly comeback to this hotel ! ! you cant beat the price ! this is where you want to sleep tonight . . . trust me ! 
the front desk agents are incredibly helpful , courteous , knowledgeable and truly love what they do . if you get the pleasure to stay here - i would ask for matt by name . he was so helpful to me . he gave me the inside scoop of millennium park and the surrounding area . speaking of the area - it is right on the chicago river , just a nice stroll down ( literally ) to michigan avenue . in between millennium park and the wrigley building . 
very nice hotel , but the bed was pretty hard . large bathroom , big room , huge closet and okey location . . shopping on michigan avenue was walkable . i was there aug , N-N , N and the weather was pleasant enough to walk the magnificent mile . the carpeting on the Nst floor could use some cleaning though . weekend breakfast buffet was N . i ended up having a croissant and coffee in the lobby which was excellent and only N . ordered room service the day i arrived and the pizza was awful . since i was starving and the cost was N , i ate it anyway . staff was very friendly . when i did go to the gift shop , it was closed and the sign said the employee would return in N minutes . . i never went back . overall , this was an okey hotel . i do admit though , it did not meet the expectations of what i have frequently read about fairmont hotels . 
we just returned from a four night stay at the the seneca . i booked this trip through a travelzoo promotion ( N night for deluxe suite ) before i read any trip advisor reviews . since it was a non-refundable rate , there was no turning back . the exterior and interior of the hotel are full of charm and the staff is very polite and helpful . though the elevators are small , they exude the character of the period and were always available when called . we arrived way before check-in and our luggage was safely stored and the hotel staff advised us of the best way to get to our desired locations . our luggage was promptly delivered to our Nth floor room with a hotel provided baby bed upon check-in . the room was a deluxe suite which included a bedroom , bathroom , two walk-in closets , living room , dining area with table for four and full-size kitchen with everything you need if you want to cook . the space was just right for our family of five with the exception of the bathroom . it was very small . the overall decor was extremely dated but everything was clean . the two closets are a waste however , one was so large that it served as bedroom for the baby . there were no black-out curtains in either room , so we were up with the sun . our floor had a very clean , coin operated washer and dryer which ended up coming in handy after a couple of baby accidents . there is a small but efficient gym on the top floor with about N machines and free weights . everyday i was in there , it was being cleaned . there were always fresh towels to use and a full water cooler as well as a flat screen tv . also on the top floor is a beautiful and underused roof deck . i don ' t know if you can see the navy pier fireworks from there but it is worth trying . if i were to travel to chicago again with my family , i would definitely stay here again . the location was perfect , the price was right and we had plenty of space in our room . if i were to go with just my husband , i would probably stay somewhere a little more luxurious . all in all , this was a budget and family friendly hotel . 
had booked the room earlier in the year requesting early check-in . arrived , told room wasn ' t ready . my daughter had to change in the bathroom to attend conference . upon return to the hotel later in the afternoon , the room we were given was double booked . had to wait while they moved that gentleman out and recleaned the room . staff is indifferent . for the price charged for the room , the hotel is quite plain , the inconvenience - never stay here again . willing to pay more for a nicer , more friendly place
we stayed at the hotel allegro when we recently visited chicago to see the musical , wicked . the trendy boutique hotel had been recommended by several friends , and it was miles from ordinary but steps from everything . allegro is located in the theater area and near one of the el stations it was only a block and a half to traverse before making it to the property . friendly bellmen escorted us in , and we ascended the staircase to the second level to check in ( we discovered the nearby elevator later ) . the lobby reminded us of a contemporary mod Ns motif with red velvet couches , oversized midnight blue chairs and modern light fixtures . dark wood covered the walls and was paired with a large , checkerboard carpet in brown and cream . the front desk staff was welcoming , explaining the business center , fitness area that i truly thought we would use and the surrounding areas . this lobby also serves as the locale where free unlimited wine flows during the wine hour , each evening from N-N p . m . the concierge is also located on this floor . visiting hotel allegro marked one of the few times that i have used hotel hair products . all aveda products were available and the small bathroom had a deep bathtub and marble countertops . the hotel itself is updated from an older building , so the rooms are not large according to today s standards . we had enough space , and the rooms were carefully decorated in chocolate and salmon with accents of gold and light green . in an armoire , the expansive mini bar was stocked with a small refrigerator and dry goods area contained anything from red bull to snacks and even hangover remedies . a cd player was available as well . the closet housed an iron and ironing board , but by no means was this closet large , even to the smallest of munchkinlanders . the encore liquid lounge had a groovy feel with upbeat tempos . we appreciated the wicked-themed martinis such as the lollypop kid , making for an even better night of theater . people from all walks ( literally there was a race that weekend ) stopped in for drinks before or after the theater , on the way to dinner or as a nightcap . the bartenders were extremely attentive , even on the busiest nights . food may also be purchased . N chicago is the adjacent , on-site restaurant serving breakfast , lunch and dinner . allegro s amenities stretched from leopard print robes delivered on request to a complimentary yoga basket to use while watching the yoga station on television . we saw plenty of pets during our stay . allegro s pet friendly policy is actually a good one - there is no weight limit and furry creatures can even book their own happy tails hotel package . our only complaint was not even the hotel s fault . a gaggle of teenagers stayed on our floor for a bat mitzvah and did not sleep much during the night , which meant that we had the privilege of enjoying their noise . the walls are definitely thin , although our room on the sixth floor overlooking the el did not have any street noise . the convenient location did prove to be in the middle of everything , even a parade . as we were in chicago during memorial day weekend , the parade was gearing up just as we were leaving our hotel and we were able to enjoy it before moving on to nearby shopping on state street and michigan avenue . we walked to both areas , but michigan avenue might merit a cab ride home , depending on the amount of shopping completed . also nearby is the new millennium park , grant park , the art institute , tons of dining and more . we would definitely go back . it was the perfect complement to a weekend of culture in chicago . 
i stayed here in december of N for a convention at mccormick place . location couldn ' t have been better , never had to walk outside to get to the conference . the room was nice , with a nice view of the lake ( i was on the Nth floor , not facing the city ) . overall , the room was clean , but there were minor things that would have made it better - what appeared to be a coffee stain in the carpet , some mior touchup in the paint in the bathroom . also , the heating was finicky , although it worked fine overall ( blew cool air when it reached temperature instead of shutting off at times ) . the iron looked hardly used , but could have used replacement . the restaurants on site were pretty good , especially liked shor . they a resort-priced , but right on target for what i ' ve seen in chicago price-wise . there is a metra station right next to the hotel , and the N cta train runs right in front ot the hyatt to michigan avenue , so although the location isn ' t necessarily in the heart of downtown , it ' s very accessible with public transportation . the service at the hotel was very good . every staff member i had dealings with treated me very well , and made me feel welcome . i absolutely will stay he again when i return next year . on a final note , the bed at this hotel was among the most comforatble i have ever slept in , including my own bed at home . i highly recommend this place . 
palomar ' s location on state street near illinois is central to all of chicago ' s best . staff here treats you royally from check-in to check-out . our room wasspotless and oversized and the hotel has a rooftop lap pool and state of the art fitness center . an evening social of wine along with delicious flatbreads is served from N to N in a beautiful street level room with horizontal fireplace and cozy chairs and decorative allure . morning coffee and tea is available early each day . one thing i might suggest is a complimentary breakfast along with the coffee since this area is a gathering place and a light bite along with morning coffee would be most appreciated . on anothewr note , palomar ' s restaurant sable has a fine dining reputation whcih we will be sure to check out at our next stay . 
this was our first time at this residence inn and our weekend stay was great . we know the area well . we love all the action in the river north section of town . the room was large with a bedroom , sitting room and kitchen . it was super clean with all the amenities . we had five people in the sitting room for a visit and we could have held N more . the price was very reasonable ( even though chicago rates are getting pretty high ) . a great quality to price ratio . the staff was extremely friendly and helpful without getting " in your face " . we ' ll definitely be back . 
having stayed in a few kimpton hotels , we decided to try the new palomar in chicago for a family weekend . the location is great , a few blocks from michigan ave . , walking distance to theaters and wonderful restaurants . the staff was very friendly and didn ' t not ignore the kids as is the case at many " hip boutique " hotels . they were given goody bags , with colored pencils , yoyos etc . everything needed to keep a " bored " kid busy while waiting for dinner , the yoyos were in constant use on our walks around the city . the room was a true one bedroom suite with ample couch room for the two kids . the bathroom was glorious , one of the largest bathtubs i have ever seen ! as for the restaurant and bar , the bar has one of the best cocktail menus , more of a book , i have ever seen . defining hand crafted . the only meal we eat at the hotel was a breakfast , which was good , but the service was very slow , possibly due to the fact that is was sunday morning at opening time . we would highly recommend this kimpton property , it is now our first choice for weekend getaways in chicago . 
it was not a bad hotel , but i will not ever stay again . i believed the other reviews , and took a chance . though people may have mentioned some good things , there were so many small things that were not good , they all added up . they list a dvd player in each room . when we were put on hold about the missing player , the recording they play as you wait , boasted about the dvd players in each room . we were told the owners got rid of them . they also got rid of the coffee pots ! there are no raised floor bottoms on the shower , so an extra drain is in front of the toilet , for the water . water flows freely all over the bathroom floor under the shower curtain . the tv was on the far right of the room , though the N beds are in the middle . tv was in a little cubby area , not good for viewing . the fridge was so small , it only has enough room for the mini-bar items . if you want to use it , you have to remove all the pay stuff , and have the bar items take up nearly all of the limited counter space . elevators barely held N people and our luggage . no joke . N person max , and no room for luggage with N ! hot elevator temp . smallest lobby i have ever seen . about the size of my great room and kitchen . the main lobby being a great room , and the coffee area like my kitchen . . air conditioning in the lobby and halls were none , or limited . concierge never answered my emails sent N days before my trip . location was good , but there are better at this price . rooms were clean , bedding was great . robes were shown in photos . no robes . no vending machines of any kind . lobby offers free coffee and water . ice only on every other floor . staff was friendly . we had to change rooms . Nst room had a garbage dumpster outside our window , and was old , odd shaped , and poorly arranged . . second room had a nicer view , and was newer . Nnd room also had better tv placement . tvs were flat screen , hd . the channels however , were not hd , so we had to adjust the screen width so we did not have to watch everything stretched . all rooms are not equal . old room had a huge bathroom , huge like a locker room . very odd . . nicer Nnd room had a tiny tiny bathroom , but it did have a ledge to stop the water . it only had a shower door though . . no soap dish in the showers . no hook or ring for a hand towel . no cup in the bathroom . both bathrooms had an odd placement for the bath towels . right above the toilet paper . unless you folded your towels in , they covered the toilet paper . carpet was like kitchen carpet , flat and a little stained , though clean . N rocks glasses at the bar , but no cup to brush your teeth . bathroom scale and remote both needed new batteries . maids were quiet and courteous . other guests were also quiet and courteous . one thing i will list as a deal breaker though , was the air conditioning . in both of our rooms , the air was a dial thermostat . ( a dial like an . am radio ) the air in both rooms was set at N degrees . this is the lowest setting . my guess was it was around N to N degrees in the room , with no way to go lower . not horribly hot , but never refreshingly cool by any measure . they claimed the Nnd room had updated or recently cleaned air vents , filters , etc . . but it was the same . there is no reason whatsoever to choose this hotel over any other . i hope my words have a ring of truth , as i tried to mention good as well as not so good . not bad , just not good . the N dollar a day internet is really too much . many chicago hotels are free internet , and the ones who charge range from N-N dollars . also , you have to get a code every N hours for the internet . we take a trip to chicago every year , for the past N or N yrs . different hotel every time . this is my Nst review of any chicago downtown hotel . i d never been disappointed before . we ve never stayed at the hyatt , or hilton . we always stay at mid-priced chains . our Nst so-called boutique , and our last . 
for me , this is the best location in chicago . you are on state street with a view of the river and can walk within a few minutes to the theater district or michigan ave for some shopping . the service at this hotel is what you would expect for the price - first rate . the rooms are comfortable , nicely decorated , and most offer a good view . from our room we could see the river , the chicago theatre , and the wrigley building . this hotel is pricey , but worth it . on our stay , we were on the Nth floor and had only two problems . first , there were some guests who were a bit loud in the hallway . i called the front desk and security came to quiet them immediately ( both times ) . the hotel can ' t keep guests from being a bit loud while enjoying themselves , but they did all they could to keep them quiet after receiving complaints , so i appreciated that . the second problem was that there were a lot of sirens in the city and we could hear them from our room . i ' ve stayed in chicago many times and have experienced the same problem at all hotels , so there isn ' t anything that can be done about that . just ask for a room as high up as you can get , but even the top floor won ' t keep you from hearing sirens . parking is steep , but there are plenty of self-park garages nearby , so choose one of those to save a few dollars , if you are interested . 
great location , great service , great rooms ! i would definitely stay here again . 
i ' m a chicago native ( tho ' moved away in ' N ) and went " home " for a weekend with my husband to visit friends . this hotel was perfect . the location was great . . . basically dearborn and division . we took the cta for N each from midway airport to the hotel . went smoothly except for a few flights of stairs with luggage . if you ' re a bit adventurous , the cta ' s definitely a value ! the hotel ' s style reminded me of an upscale hotel that you ' d find in a european city . . . rooms are small , but the decorating was " edgy " in a very cool way . granite counter tops in the bathrooms , pergo flooring in the room with an area rug , one wall was covered with huge blueberry wallpaper . ( yes , like someone took a photo of a basket of just-washed blueberries , and blew it up into a wall-sized photograph ! ) linens and bedding were pristine . room was very clean . only drawback was that room was located directly across from the elevator and we could hear folks chattin ' while waiting and the " ding " when the elevator arrived . staff was friendly and helpful , phone system was easy to use ( voice mail wake up calls ) . we did not eat there . ( hotel has a limited breakfast menu , but what they had looked appetizing and the seating area looked clean and , again , had that cool decorating thing goin ' on . ) had breakfast a few doors down at Nrd coast cafe--also highly recommend the selection there is more of a bacon eggs , bigger breakfast type thing . " mother ' s " ( a fairly well-known bar ) was around the corner . lots of fun . . . sang ' til N Nam with the rest of the folks at the bar . crowd was about N years younger than we were , but they didn ' t seemed bothered by us old folks ( we ' re in our forties ) . the wait staff there was pleasant , even at that hour , and since mother ' s had only popcorn to eat , our waitress suggested we run across the street , pick up a pizza and bring it back in ! we had a ball . . . 
my wife and i needed a hotel downtown to stay at while we celebrated our N year anniversary . we stayed downtown on our wedding night , so we wanted to stay downtown again . but it was the week of a huge music festival and prices were skyhigh . so we searched and found a great price online for the whitehall . we knew nothing about it , but looked it up on tripadvisor ( as we always do ) . many people had good , and some bad things to say about the hotel . . . but our experience was all good . first , great location . blocks away from the hancock building , shopping , great food . . . and everything is in walking distance . second , the hotel is classically beautiful and clean . finally , they treated us well . we had a problem with our air conditioner , they fixed it quickly . when they found out it was our anniversary , they upgraded us . we were thrilled with our whole experience and would recomend it highly . 
i always enjoy staying at this hotel in the heart of chicago ' s magnificent mile for business . i have stayed here a few times and just have to write to say i hate that small bathroom ! the door is in the way and the tissue ( this time around ) was not a hook , just placed on the bathroom lid ! mind you , that is probably not the best place for it . otherwise , the hotel was fine . 
our son ' s entry into the chicago marathon presented the opportunity for a short visit to chicago . a four day reservation was arranged cheerfully and without difficulty . our arrival through o ' hare international two days prior to the marathon gave adequate time to settle-in and to gain a perspective on hotel facilities and navigation around the city . catching the train from o ' hare delivered us within three blocks from our hotel . the hotel proved to be an ideal location as a launch pad for touring the city and for short foot-bound excursions to many nearby attractions . the hotel is within blocks of ground transportation and was a short distance to many critical waypoints along the marathon route . when coming " home " to the hotel we always received a friendly and courteous greeting from the hotel staff . room service was equally cordial and helpful . the rooms were spacious and sparkling clean . the hotel ' s breakfast buffets were great as were the extended facilities . we would recommend this hotel to family and friends and will return at our earliest convenience . 
we made our reservation using priceline name your price and save N . N off the expedia rate . the hotel is very convenient to the attractions we wanted to see . it sits right on the chicago river and if you get a room on the north end of the west tower you will have a great view of the chicago river and lake michigan . houllihan ' s restaurant is one block to the west and has a great breakfast bar that is considerably less than the hotel restaurant . the staff are friendly , the room was quiet , the bed was great and we slept well . buy your own water from the N-eleven store N blocks west . the bottled water in the room is very expensive . don ' t open the refrigerator unless you want to be charged for using it . 
my wife and i stayed here for one night and also used the spa services . i got a deep tissue massage which was awesome , my wife got a facial . the place was very clean and the staff was pleasant and accommodating . the hotel itself is very hip , it has a real club feel . the first floor bar and second floor lobby have a good layout , great decoration and in the evening they are comfortably crowded with a nice atmosphere . the rooms are unique but very comfortable . great view out the floor to ceiling window and you can tell that everything is new . quick note on the shower it shares a wall glass window with the room . the glass is covered with a curtain , but if you want to you can open the curtain from the room to have a full view of the shower in use . pretty fun . overall , this place is awesome and a great place for chicago . 
just stayed here again for vacation . another great stay . the room was a great size . love having a coffee maker , microwave refrigerator in the room , with trader joe ' s next door this can save you lots . the staff was always pleasant and very helpful . it is a great location just one block off the magnificent mile . will always stay here for pleasure or business when in town . just great location and value for the cost . 
i stayed at the fairmont in august N . it ' s a bit far away to write this review but i thought i would drop a line since i had a great experience . we booked through expedia . ca . i had written a comment to ask if we could get an upgrade since this is a special trip . i went with my aunt who had never travelled outside of toronto since she moved from hk N years ago and it was her first time taking the plane and visiting the us . the hotel gave us a big suite with N separate beds and we had a beautiful view . we stayed here for N nights and the service is fantastic . we forgot our slippers and called room service late at night and they came very quickly . the rooms are what you see on the website ' s pictures . and the hotel is very generous with the toiletries like shower cap , soap , shampoo , conditioner , shoe mit . if you need toothpaste , they will also bring it up . only downside is it ' s a bit of a walk to magnificent mile - a good N minutes . it ' s windy and very sunny so be sure to bring a scarf a light jacket at night . but it ' s close to the millenium park and the bean . there ' s a grocery store close to the hotel so we grabbed some snacks there . we also walked almost everywhere but took a cab to a nice restaurant further away . i highly recommend this hotel , the staff at the front desk are nice , accommodating and there ' s no attitude or snottiness . i booked early so i think you should do that if you want to secure a good price . we had a room on a high floor and never heard any noise from the the rooms next door . we didn ' t eat at the hotel restaurants and preferred venturing to cafes on magnificent mile and other streets in that area . 
stayed N nights in april . our room was very nice and newly renovated . six lifts so no long wait , you had to have a room key to use the lift after N . Npm . very large hotel so staff appeared not to be aware what was going on expect in there own area , front desk staff could not tell me opening hours for the bars or restaurants . as it is such a big hotel it has no atmosphere . booked this hotel on hotwire so got a bit of value would have been disappointed if i had paid full price . 
first time in chicago . . . stuck with one of our favourite hilton chains and we were not disappointed . very well priced . great location . walking distance to the theatre we were attending . close to three transit lines and a couple stops to shopping during the day and blues clubs at night . the rooms were well decorated , laid out and quite comfortable . what we have come to expect from a hampton . 
we just got home from a weekend at the palmer house-what a wonderful experience ! not only was it a beautiful hotel but everyone was so accomodating and friendly ! ! i will definetly stay there again ! ! 
stayed here for N nights . good location , near to the mag . mile . very large hotel with typical service ( both good and bad ) that you would expect . long wait for check-in - the three people on the desk kept disappearing for long periods behind a screen ! lady on the concierge was not very friendly ( as i see others have noted ) , and looked surprised that i wanted to know how to get to the art institute . worst thing was the sound insulation in the rooms . i had two connecting doors , and could hear everything from next door -conversations , toilet , television - well , i mean everything ! had to sleep with ear plugs in ! when will hotels learn that , if they have rooms with connecting doors , these should at least be insulated properly when not in use eg with padding or a sound-proof cover . i paid almost N per night , but it was like staying in a N star motel . no chance to move room as the hotel was completely full . apart from that it was ok - but the maid did keep knocking on the door , despite the fact that i had a do not disturb card on the door ! also , the soap in the shower gave me a rash ! i think there are better hotels in chicago for these prices . 
the raffaello is in a great location for spending a few days in chicago shopping and sightseeing . we self-parked our car at the garage across the street for N per day and left it there the entire time . great shopping and restaurants all within walking distance . the hotel itself is in a fairly quiet location . we had a double room which was pretty spacious for a downtown hotel . the beds were very comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean . the front desk staff was not very friendly , but the bell captains were always polite and helpful . we booked a N-night special through the hotel website for N per night which i would say was a great value for this convenient , updated hotel . 
the w lakeshore hotel is a great place to stay hands down ! ! i traveled solo on a business trip from new york and the treatment from when i walked into the " living room " to when i checked in was superb . the whatever whenever experience was executed to a t . whenever i requested a toothbrush , shaving kit and even floss , the young lady raquel brought it up to me with a smile . she was very kind and always used her name and never ceased to let me know if i needed anything else to let her know . i felt like i was bothering her at times but she didnt mind at all . . w lakeshore crew , you guys rock ! ! ! 
i have spend two separate weeks at this property recently , once during the month of january and once during february . this property is quite large though their staffing seems to have been greatly reduced . the concierge desk was never manned . i never saw more than two staffmembers at the front desk . the rooms are quite dated but are of a standard size and adequately maintained . the animal print wallpaper is peeling at spots and the furniture in the rooms is showing more than average wear and tear . the location of this property is just north of the chicago river and one block east of michigan avenue . the loop and the magnificent mile are within easy walking distance . the airport is easily accessed by cathing the N busline ( directly behind the pj clarke ' s restaurant in front of the hotel ) which will take you to milwaukee where you can catch the blue line to o ' hare . chicago ' s buses are equipped with visual and auditory indications for each stop . there are several excellent restaurants within walking distance of this hotel . transportation is excellent with a cta ( chicago transit authority ) N-day pass available for N . you can purchase this pass at the blue line station at o ' hare . beware if you are looking for dinner after a day of business meetings you will be hard set to find any restaurants open after Npm ! 
i stayed at this hotel when doing business at an office on the magnificent mile . the hotel was very functional . . . free wifi was a plus . . . and the adjoining starbucks was very convenient . i ordered room service one evening which took a very long time to arrive , but the next morning i had a note of apology under my door with a gift certificate for a free starbucks coffee . the room service food , though , was very good . i went out for a run one afternoon and found it easy to run down to millenium park and back in about N minutes . the last time i was doing business in this location , i stayed at the w hotel near the lake . it is obviously difficult to compare the two hotels , but i would stay at the courtyard again next time just for its basic good service , convenience , and functionality . 
a group of us stayed at the w lakeshore for a weekend for my sister ' s bachelorette party . we chose the package deal which was supposed to include a luxury suite for the bride and N friends , limo transportation to and from the clubs , and special vip treatement at le passage . instead , we got a suite with one king bed ( for N people ) , a bus , and the bouncers at le passage acted as though they had no idea what we were talking about . so obviously i ' d never recommend the bachelorette package . in addition , checking in took forever , the staff was unfriendly and rude , and the hotel decor is overrated . the only thing we liked about our stay were the bliss products in the bathroom ! 
this is the first time i stayed at the wyndham blake hotel . the common areas are uninspiring but the rooms are very large and nice . there are many drawers for storage in the rooms and in the bathrooms . my bathroom was also larger than an average hotel bathroom and and nicely decorated . the view out the window was a brick wall but i didn ' t get the room for the view . i wish i had tried the breakfast but i didn ' t . i had to get to work too early . the breakfast opens about N am . there is a restaurant that is attached and next door . it is pricey and not a place for a quick dinner on a business trip . it is more of a date-night-out restaurant . the door man , and the rest of the staff , were very helpful . overall , i liked the hotel and would recommend it to others if you need to be in the area . 
beautiful , modern rooms--a view provided based on request at check-in . fantastic concierge service--these people really love know the city--recommended things with knowlege and zeal plus there are N-N available at a time . no pool but rumor has it , you can swim somewhere nearby . gracious and accomodating staff , perfect location--be forewarned ( and the woman checking us in did tell us ) that their mini-bar is on a sensor system and if you move anything--you will be charged . 
we stayed at the seneca easter weekend N . we had a great time and really enjoyed the hotel . the people who worked there were friendly and very helpful with restaurants and bus schedules . we would stay there again and not think twice about it . our room was nice and big and clean . the tv worked just fine . didn ' t use the kitchen but there seemed to be plenty of dishes , pans and silverware . maybe the people who had a problem with the staff had an attitude of there own . we found the staff to be very friendly and helpful . we ate in the restaurant upstairs and had a super meal . the hotel is right off of michigan ave , where you can walk everywhere you want to go . 
came from las vegas to chicago for a family wedding . the hotel was beautiful , staff was great very helpful . beds were the best i have ever had in a hotel room . hotel was in great location walking distance to everything . staff was top notch very helpful . 
great hotel - great room size . concierge was very helpful . overall wonderful experience ! 
if it weren ' t for the location there would be nothing about this hotel that was positive . the room was slightly larger than a walk in closet and stunk like a moldy basement . the bathroom door had a broken hinge and couldn ' t close . the toilet didn ' t want to flush . the tv reception was terrible . there were cigarette butts all over the window ledge in this non smoking room . the shower was a joke . . no pressure and tepid water temp . the shower curtain was too short so water got everywhere . the floors looked dirty and the paint on the woodwork was all chipped . the hallway smelled worse than the room and needed repairs to the walls and baseboards . there were picketers outside who kept blowing loud shrill whistles as they picketed . it took the valet over N N hour to get our car for us from the parking lot just around the corner . if we could have found another hotel we would have ran as fast as we could from this one . all in all , the worse hotel experience we ever had . and all this at a N-N star price , what a rip off . 
my business partner and i travel to chicago every year for a convention . last year we stayed at the ritz carlton and it was very nice , if not a bit stodgy . we had walked by the sofitel and i thought i ' d give it a try . the hotel is very modern and beautiful . even though i ' m N years old now , i can at least pretend that i am young and hip . we booked N junior suites for about the same as we would ' ve paid at the ritz . my partner got a awesome corner room . i ended up in a ' disabled ' junior suite . while i would ' ve preferred my partner ' s room , my room was still very nice . being that it was for disabled guests it had N seperate showers and a seperate tub in the bathroom . it also had these really cool automatic curtains that my partner ' s room didn ' t have . anyway , stil a really cool room . there are two bars downstairs both pouring great french champagne by the glass . we ordered room service a couple of times and it was excellent . i highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again . 
i left the raffaello in late november after a very pleasant ( as always ) two-night stay . but i forgot my bag , including laptop etc . , in the garage across the street when i was packing the car to depart . didn ' t notice until i was back home . i called the hotel . staff were very helpful . a valet ran across the street and retrieved my bag . i talked to the sunday manager who arranged to have my bag shipped to me the next day . i ' ve always liked the raffaello . now i ' m a bigger fan than ever . 
the rooms in this hotel are very large and luxurious . the entryway allows one to enter without people in the hallway seeing much of the room , so there is more privacy than most hotel rooms . the closet opens from two sides - one from the bedroom and one from the bathroom . the shower and tub are located behind a glass door in the bathroom , there is a double vanity sink , and the toilet is in its own separate room . toothpaste and a toothbrush , as well as the typical amenities , are provided for free . my only negative comment about the room is that the two beds were small . there is a lap pool with several lanes and boards and fins . this is a great hotel for those looking for luxury and are willing to pay for it . 
we enjoyed our stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago . upon arrival we were treated with great hospitality . the desk staff was friendly and took the time to visit with us about our room and its pros and what she thought might be a con - the size . our room was small , but was beautiful and very comfortable . we had a great view of the lake . the furnishing seemed expensive and unique . they decor was fabulous and the bed was delightfully comfortable with great linens . the room was very clean upon arrival and was always cleaned with perfection each day we returned from our adventures throughout the city . the hotel as a whole seemed like we stepped back in time . i loved the boutique feel from the mirrored elevators , rotary style phone in the hallway to the old mail slots . we would definitely stay here again ! we loved chicago and this hotel . 
my husband and i stayed at the amalfi for N nights in july . front desk staff are amazing , very helpful . we loved the fact that breakfast is served on each floor very convenient . however , the " happy hour " or " manager ' s reception " each evening was the highlight of our stay at the amalfi . great drinks , tasty appetizers and a great way to mingle with other guests . i would stay here again and have recommended it to a number of our friends . 
our party of three stayed four nights at the comfort suites over a long weekend . the hotel couldn ' t be better located for a leisure trip to chicago just a short walk to the museums , the loop , and to shopping dining on the michigan avenue . the lobby is small if you ' re used to the fancier hotels downtown , but the rooms are larger in comparison to those we ' ve had in other downtown hotels on earlier chicago visits . we had booked a N queen suite , but were upgraded on arrival to a huge N bedroom , N bath suite ( if you ' re reading this comfort suites , thanks again ) . the room was clean but the furnishings were dated and due for upgrades and new carpet . we noted a leak at the toilet which was quickly repaired on the day we notified the front desk . the front desk was very attentive and responded quickly to any request we made . the room had a full kitchen , which we used for dinner comfortably one evening after a trip to trader joe ' s a few blocks away . our biggest pet peeves were noise and wifi access . you expect outside noise in a city like chicago , but most of the noise was internal from the a c system or from the appliances in the kitchen area . we did find that it became white noise quickly and it didn ' t keep me from comfortable sleep . however , if you ' re a light sleeper it could be an issue , especially in the front bedroom which is separated from the kitchen by an open doorway with no door . wifi is provided but for most of our stay the connection ranged from barely usable to not worth trying . breakfast was the average budget hotel quality and the hot options were lower quality than what we ' re used to . it ' s ok if you want cereal , but we found ourselves across michigan avenue at cafe decartes for excellent coffee and pastries . despite our peeves , i considered the comfort suites a great value considering that it was by far the lowest cost option for downtown chicago for a room that could house three adults comfortably . we weren ' t expecting the ritz , and the location was great and the staff as attentive and helpful as we ' ve had at much fancier hotels . 
we enjoyed this hotel this winter . the location is magnificent , N blocks from the michigan ave . , less than N meters to the red line mta train that takes you virtually everywhere . nice view ( floor N ) . the pool is very good and also the business center ( complimentary use of pc and printer ) . within the hotel there is free wifi . 
i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel ! yes , the mini-bar and rendez-vous terrace drinks are way expensive , but given the high-end nature of this hotel , not overpriced . beautiful room , bathroom , tv , comfy bed , central location , etc . i could go on ! i would definately stay here again . staff were friendly and heplful as well . 
the location is very convenient . if you are coming from the airport the blue line stops right outside of the hotel . the rooms are very clean and are kept that way each day by the housekeeping staff . the hotel is close to all chicago ' s important sites and has some great restaurants in the area . the staff is friendly and helpful . my only complaint is that breakfast is served in the small lobby so if there are a lot of guests there at the same time it can get a bit hectic . there are N computers and a printer in the lobby which was very convenient . very reasonable prices for the location and rooms . i ' ll definitely be staying there on my next trip to chicago ! 
we stayed at the ohio house last weekend on a three day stay in chicago . being a fairly expensive city , budget accomodation was something we needed and the ohio house provided . the ohio house is located close to the heart of the city ( a few blocks back from michigan avenue ) . the rooms are small to average size bathrooms average hotel size , with very N ' s style appearence and decor . most people tend to assume that budget accomodation in an expensive city means hygiene problems , however the ohio house , we found to be , was extremely clean ( N stars in that department ) . the motel also has its own small coffee house where we had breakfast on one of our days there . its was nice , but again very N ' s style which was interesting . chicago is full of delicious resturants and cafes though - my personal recommendation is a little french style cafe ' cosi ' , a block or so back from michigan avenue ) . the ohio house is also directly across the road from a large mcdonald ' s ( not that you ' d go all the way to chicago just to eat mcdonald ' s ! ) there was only one issue we had with the ohio house and that was the noise from the streets at night . but the ohio house is a very clean , comfortable stay for anyone wishing to take a budget holiday in chicago - which was a beautiful city . personally , i would stay there again if i was looking for budget accomodation - but should there be available funds , i would probably choose to stay in one of the larger hotels in the city . 
what i loved stayed in the historic building ( the hotel is two buildings conjoined - one old , one new ) and our room was large and lovely . bathroom had both a tub and a shower . beds were lovely with that " sheet on the outside of the blanket and inside of the blanket " thing going on , which is so nice . pillows very comfortable . we loved loved loved the " eno " wine bar downstairs - they do cheese , chocolate and wine only - how neat is that ? we tasted a different flight each night we were there . hotel is close to almost everything - just a couple blocks away from the river to catch the architecture tour on the millenium mile for great shopping , easy walking distance from the red line , easy walking distance from fantastic restaurants ( we went to frontera grill and cafe grand lux ) . annoyances couldn ' t properly open the curtains to let light in the hotel room . gym and computer usage were extra and pricey ( altho i sprang for the gym and it was very well stocked with equipment ) . pool area was beautiful - tho not quite as lovely as swisshotel - where the pool has the best view in the city . overall , would give swisshotel the nod for their more beautiful view of the lake , but this hotel was still quite ideal . 
the hotel burnham is a great spot in chicago ' s theatre district and near many downtown tourist attractions ( e . g . sears tower , chicago theatre , etc . ) . some of the more unique features of the hotel include an old style elevator with gate and the use of keys to open your room . . . yes , real keys ( not cards ) ! the rooms are small , but very tastefully done , with a beautiful poster bed and canopy . the windows are decorated with velvet like curtains with musical scores by mozart in gold colored script , to emphasize the hotel ' s proximity to various performing arts venues . each evening , the hotel hosts a wine reception in the lobby , which is a nice respite after a long workday . the breakfast menu is also quite enjoyable , especially the delicious eggs benedict and fresh squeezed orange juice . i only spent two nights here , but would be happy to come back ! 
my family and i scored a great rate of N a night for the sheraton for a quick weekend trip to chicago . the hotel is in a good location and even though it was february , we were still able to walk to michigan ave . fairly easily from the hotel . check-in was quick and easy . the lobby is beautiful and definitely makes the hotel look like a N-star but that ' s about where the stars start to fade . the elevators are clean and quick . our rooms were on the Nth floor . there were newspapers and food trays strewn about the hallway as we arrived and they were not removed until the following day . the rooms were reasonably clean with the exception of a piece of candy on our floor , a large iron burn mark on the middle of the bedspread and some mold on the shower head . these are things that are easy to overlook in a N or N star hotel but i think it is unacceptable in a N-star hotel . the rooms are good size and the beds are comfortable with decent linens . the toiletries are higher end and made the shower more enjoyable . the mini-bar is an absolute joke as the prices are ridiculous . a bottle of water was N . N ! my parents ate in the breakfast restaurant and said the food was fresh and pretty good . we were only at the hotel for a few nights but it suited our needs . i don ' t think i would stay at this hotel if i had to pay full price for a room but i would definitely stay here again for N or less . 
we came from gatineau and stayed for N days at the indigo in beginning of october . it was very nice . thanks to tom and the lovely staff over there . we had a wonderful time ! 
i was surprised and very disappointed with the bad service here . westin hotels are usually pretty good but this was not the case here . i only stayed N night and had quite a few problems . some were small ( but irritating ) and good hotels always pay attention to the small details . that was not the case here . for example ( N ) room service lunch - they included bread rolls but not enough butter ( N ) room service dinner - it took N mins to arrive and they sent the wrong order . since it was after N . Npm the kitchen was then closed . i was put on hold for N minutes and then told i could order from a local italian take-out ( they would pay ) . an ok response i guess but by then it was near midnight and i would have to wait again for the food . ( N ) the room only had N dim lights and was very dark . i called " service express " to get an additional light sent to the room . i had to call them N times before anyone delivered a light ( despite being told during the first N calls that it was coming ) . this took at least N hours . i will not stay here again . i have stayed at the sofitel before and should have gone back there - it was awesome . 
a friend and i stayed here for N nights . as it was our first time in chicago , we wanted something with easy access to shopping , lots of things to do and places to eat . the allerton did not disappoint . we were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to do ( parks , navy pier , shopping , restaurants , etc ) . we did have to take a bus to bucktown , but the stop was right near the hotel . the staff were friendly , though we didn ' t interact with them too much . the room was in good condition and clean , but the layout was awkward , not allowing the person on the far side of the bed much room to walk to their side ( less than a foot ) . as two girls , we didn ' t mind sharing one bed , but it was hard to get around without disturbing one an other . we were very impressed with the fitness center . there are several cardio machines ( bikes , elliptical , N treadmills ) each with their own tv screen and weight machines free weights . it was clean and there were always plenty of towels . it is bright and airy and wasn ' t overly crowded when we were there . the restaurant in the hotel was ok . it had good food , but not really a good place to have a ' night out . ' overall , we would happily stay at the allerton again it was the best value for us . 
i am no great fan of big city hotels . i prefer a nice comfort inn with free parking and breakfast . but each year i go to chicago during midwest music clinic with my kids to baby sit and help out . this year we stayed at the sheraton and i really enjoyed it . the staff was friendly and the room was beautiful , with a nice view . i made friends with the housekeeper on our floor the first day and never lacked for plenty of whatever i needed . the pool is free , although i had been confused when i read that the fitness center charged . corporate messed up my sons reservations just about every way they could , including charging for days not reserved . it was a mess , but when we arrived everything was fine . i did not eat in the hotel or use room service . on the nights i stayed in to babysit , i grabbed food from dominicks and fox and obels . this hotel is close to lots of things . a great location . 
the downtown chicago fairfield inn is a hidden gem in chicago ' s downtown . located on a tree lined street one block from the magnificent mile and N minute walk to the lake , we felt we were in a quiet hidden neighborhood in the city . the hotel is very clean , nicely decorated with a modern decor and the staff is exceptionally helpful . the suite with the living room ( pullout sofa ) , minifridge and microwave make longer stays very comfortable and would work well for families with children . 
i stayed for just one nite at the sheraton hotel and towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other ta posters but i was not let down . i got the room via pl N and was first placed in a room on the Nth floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot . since i had nothing to lose , i asked to be moved to a " room with a view " . the front desk attendant ( rasheeda ) wanted to make sure that the room i had at first was clean and was in order and i assured her that it was . she then moved me up to the Nth floor with ease and it took about N minute . i was quite surprised as i have heard that they treat pl and hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers . the new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the navy pier , a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of lake michigan . all this for N ? yep ! i skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious ! the room was comfy , had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location . i didnt use it since i wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk . the bed and pillows were very comfy , but i awoke at about N in the morning sweating from the comfy but very warm and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed . this was a great deal for the price and i would absolutely stay here again . 
my stay at the hard rock hotel was a delight . i usually try to avoid business travel because i don t get a good night sleep . this experience with you was superb ! my good night sleep helped me to enjoy the whole experience of being in chicago and attending our conference . the hotel was very interesting , exciting and so pleasant . what wonderful workers you have there . there is a real comfortable ambience about the whole hotel . thank you , thank you for a memorable experience . i intend to return not just for business but also for pleasure ! sincerely , connie chestnut cmsw alzheimer s association of southeastern wisconsin
my husband and i stayed at the hyatt recently and had a great experience . staff was friendly and helpful , rooms were updated , roomy , and very clean . the location downtown to resturants , shopping and attractions was great . to address some of the cons listed by other reviews . . the hotel is large and , as would be expected , the lobby is full of activity , including the great lobby bar that looks out over the city . yes , there is a disco club atmosphere at night but if you looked at the hotel ' s website before you booked you know exactly what you are getting . the dance club didn ' t get started until later evening when kids shouldn ' t be out anyway . we were informed in advance that if you enter the minibar a sensor is set off so there would be a charge . the parking at N a day is very average as anyone who stays in a big city would know and it was quite easy for us to get our car when we needed it without any long waits . there were also complaints listed about the hot water and towels--the water was always hot even when showering during the busy morning hours and the towels were more than adequate . we have traveled all over the world and this hyatt is a great choice for fun weekend in chicago . 
the location is great if you plan on doing a lot of running around chicago . it ' s walking distance to both lake el stations which means you have every el line close by and a straight ride from o ' hare for N . N . the lobby is large and a nice place to meet and hang out . they have N pay computers to use . i have some status and got probably the best room location , a river view at the end of the hall . the room looked like housekeeping had cleaned it in a hurry , the drawers were all open and a couple of spots needed a sweeping though . the room was a bit larger than normal and the bathroom was large . between the wide bathtub and curved shower curtain rod i felt like i was showering in a wet room . sheets and towels were of good quality as was everything else . everything else was westin nominal . definately recommend ! 
stayed here for a few days for work . the location is great on ohio between michigan and st clair , right off mag mile . there is no room service , and the elevators are inconsistent as they lights and indicators don ' t always work . the bathrooms are a little older and the window ac units are a little loud . however the rooms are clean and the service was very nice and friendly . 
this hotel was recommended by friends and it was absolutely spot on the location is great , one block at away from the magnificent mile , just off the john hancock tower and within walking distance of all major shopping . the room was large and clean , with a small kitchenette and a very clean , but relatively small bathroom . just the thing you need for a ( long ) weekend in chicago ! 
i spent a week in the chicago area and had two separate stays at the palmer house . ( spent a night in oak park for a wedding ) the first stay was disappointing but the second made up for it . the first time my boyfriend and i arrived at the hotel we were not offered any help with our luggage . i had three heavy bags and was clearly struggling . the staff was standing around in front of the door but no one could actually open it . it was very windy and the doors were heavy and the effort to open the door made me drop my suitcases . for the age of the hotel the room size was generous . the only problem was that the room was dirty . the dresser was sticky and one of the decorative pillows had a stain on it . the concierge was rude but the dinner recommendation she gave was good . the second time i arrived at the hotel valet immediately greeted us , the bellmen helped with the baggage and there was someone to open the door . my party arrived at Nam , but were able to check in early . ( the rooms weren ' t on the same floor but we opted not to wait for closer rooms . ) my boyfriend and i received an e-standby upgrade so for an additional N a night we got a huge room . there was a dining room , wet bar , large living room , two flat screen tvs , and one and a half baths . we had dinner in lockwood one night and it was pretty good . they had run out of the sparkling wine i wanted but there were plenty of other options . overall my biggest disappointment was the gift shop ( which i think was operated by an independent group . . . ) the hotel has such a rich history and a beautiful logo but there weren ' t any souvenir options that reflected this . the only hotel specific items were one out dated postcard and a tee shirt . the picture on the post card did not show the current furnishings and decor of the lobby and the shirt was very plain and over priced . i would have liked a hotel magnet or something with the peacock logo . 
i stayed at the burnham for a recent business trip to chicago . from the time i checked in , till the time i checked out the staff could not have been more accomodating . the hotel is located right across the street from macy ' s on state street and N N N blks from the el . i took the train from midway and it was a short walk to the hotel . the room was small , but well appointed . appreciated the in-room controls for air and heat . room service was able to accomodate my request for something " not on the menu " . definitely made my trip very enjoyable . 
had to go to chicago and stayed at the drake . the hotel itself was really beautiful and what you would imagine a grand hotel would be like . our room faced the water which was very nice . good size and clean . obviously the location cannot be beat-you ' re close to everything ! concierge friendly and made us dinner reservations . it ' s not super deluxe but there is a distinct charm that cannot be replicated in some of the newer , more modern or fancier hotels in chicago . loved that chanel was located in the hotel ! 
we loved this hotel and would definitely come back . initially we weren ' t given a goldfish , which was disappointing , but then we left a tip for the housekeeper , and she rewarded us with one . we had fun sipping wine and playing wii in the lobby every afternoon . the staff were quite friendly and helpful , even printing our boarding passes for us . our room was very comfortable , with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper . at first we were worried about noise , since our room was next to the elevator , but we hardly heard it , and didn ' t notice any street noise either . the hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated , well-lit , and ideally located . 
i was able to stay at the w hotel lakeshore with a family member that had a comp stay for a business trip . the hotel is located in front of lake michigan off chicago ' s famous scenic lake shore drive . the hotel room was very modern and hip and beds were comfortable . . the bathroom looked really cool . . . but wasn ' t very practical . it was dark so it was tough to see clearly in the mirrors . there wasn ' t much sink space , the shower was a bit tricky and there were slotted doors and windows connecting the bathroom to the bed area so you could hear everything . the view on the other hand was spectacular . it looked right onto lake michigan and navy pier . the hallways leading to the rooms reminded us off decor taken from tlc ' s trading spaces with smooth pebble stones bordering the walls floor . we didn ' t take advantage of the fitness or pool area nor the restaurants , but there is a great ( but expensive bar ) on the roof ( whiskey room ) ) with one of the best views of chicago at night . and there is a trendy bar on the first floor off the lobby that caters to the hip after work crowd . the location is a bit out of the way but walking distance to michigan avenue shopping restaurants and the john hancock building . the doorman can easily get taxi ' s there as well . it is also pretty close cab ride to navy pier and to the amc river east N movie theater . so overall , if you are looking for a trend setting hip place thats a little pricey but has a great view this would be a place to go . 
i have stayed here N times in the past N days and i have been thoroughly impressed with the property and staff . everyone is friendly , professional , and helpful . yes , things can and do wrong from time to time - it would be foolish to think otherwise . however , it is how the staff handle the situation or problem is what counts , and this staff always step up to the plate , apologize ( even if it is not their fault ) and immediately begin to resolve it . the hotel is in a great location , about a block from michigan ave ( major shopping ) and very easy walks to subway metro , as well as state street , rush st , and other sights . the rooms are immaculate , clean , and well maintained . i never had a problem at all in their area and have always been happy sleeping on these amazing beds ! the wifi is reasonably priced , but there are plenty of free hot spots within walking distance . i am a little sad that they do not have a pool - probably , my single downside with this hyatt . prices fluctuate a lot so check often . i have scored rooms between N- N . the area is safe , walkable , and family friendly ! 
the fairmont hotel in chicago has the best value for a weekend in chicago . it is a great location . just south of the mag mile , and just north of millenium park . i took my wife for her birthday and we arrive mid-friday afternoon . we were very courteously greeted by the doorman , escorted by the bell hop to the front desk . he waited while we checked in and then delivered our bags to our room while we retreated directly to the bar for a relaxing " happy hour " . they had some very nice light snacks on the menu there . the hotel is not the most up to date , but the room was very nice and clean , with a very comfortable bed . we walked north for dinner in the evening . in the morning they had an excellent selection of pastries and fruit in the atrium for reasonable prices , plus fresh oj and coffee . i liked that much better than the room service option because you could pick out exactly what you wanted . after a late checkout we took a nice walk through millenium park and the art intitute before heading home . this was our Nnd stay the the chicago fairmont and we it will continue to be our choice for downtown chicago . we have also stayed at other fairmonts and found them to be excellent as well . 
the w hotel greets you with glitter , glamour , and warmth . there is plentiful help right at the door . inside , the lobby is a work of art married with hospitality . concierge service always available right there . the room we stayed in had a wonderful view , great decore , and was very comfortable . the bathroom was something i had never seen before . the fixtures were the latest design , and there was plenty of mirror and counter space . the walls of the bathroom were woven wood , and there was an opening with shutters so you could see out and watch tv while shaving , perhaps . soundproof it was not , making it easy to carry on a conversation with the door slid shut , but not so easy to cover noises you might not want to carry out into the room . there is a super gift boutique just off the lobby with elegant cosmetics and fashions . staying at the w was a memorable experience . the memory still makes me smile . 
what a great find ! inexpensive ( compared to most downtown chicago hotels ) , convenient location , and a great room . i have read other reviews that complained about the size of the rooms my room was perfectly big enough for me and would have been fine for two . the bed was great , comfortable , the room very elegant and servicable . small but very well-appointed bathroom with a huge shower . plenty of storage throughout room . room and entire hotel was clean , clean , clean . great eatery attached ( english pub ) with great wait-staff , or you can order in and have food delivered . valet parking reasonable and convenient ( and pleasant attendants ) . the hotel was full of students that night , but my room was N quiet . as a very frequent traveler i highly recommend this hotel . happy travels ! 
i stayed here while attending a conference at the marriott across the street . this was cheaper and more comfortable . as other reviewers have noted , this is a gem of a hotel . it ' s a true suite , with living room , full kitchen , and bedroom . the living room has a sofabed , sitting chair , coffee table and N " lcd tv . there is a small dining table desk next to the kitchen . the kitchen has microwave , two burner oven , dishwasher , coffee maker , fridge . also plates , pots pans and silverware . the room was clean and comfortable with no obvious signs of wear . the king size bed was also comfy , though not as high end as you would find in a nicer hotel . there is a regular tube tv in the bedroom . the free buffet breakfast had scrambled eggs , meats , cereal , make your own waffles , etc . there is also a dinner with a different menu mon-thurs but i did not have that . there is a gym inhouse , but you can use the crunch gym next door ( same building ) that is much bigger and has everything . the entrance is not much to look at just an elevator to the sixth floor where reception is . but the bellman was friendly and the reception desk was efficient and very friendly . it does cost a lot to park here ( i think N night so don ' t bring a car ) . there is a small store next to reception , open N N . free wired and wireless internet in the room . only minor complaint is that the walls are somewhat thin so if the neighbor raises his voice i can hear it . also , i can hear water running next door . but all in all i would definitely stay here again . it ' s much more comfortable and better value than the big hotels nearby . 
my college best friend and i choose to visit chicago for a weekend and wanted to find a hotel with a good price and a decent location . the hilton chicago fit the bill and had a hilton double points offer , which was very appealing . it was also just a short cab ride from the train station . the check-in process took quite awhile as we had to wait in a rather long line . however , we were given a complimentary upgrade to one of their double-beded two bathroom rooms with a lakeview ( we had only booked a double-bedded room so i believe we got a bit of a deal ) . we were happy to have a lake view and it was immensely helpful to have two bathrooms ! however , there was only one hairdryer but we deduced that was so we don ' t blow a fuse , and we took turns . though it is not on the busy magnificant mile area ( it ' s a little farther south ) , it is still in a good location and a short walk to the field museum . the lobby and common areas are really impressive , with historic decor . 
i travel at least N times a yr for work and twice a year with family , so i put in a lot of time at hotels . my room was freezing cold and the thermometer in the room didn ' t make a difference . i was told by engineering that the hotel had turned on ac and it would take a couple of hours for the heat to come back on . i ended up taking a long hot shower and getting in bed and using the blow dryer to warm me up . they promised to send up hot tea , but after N minutes and no delivery i had to call to ask . about N minutes later a pot of tea showed up , but it was highly caffeinated breakfast tea at N N at night ! ! ! the same night , someone attempted to enter my room . luckily i had both locks on . i think it was housekeeping . i don ' t know how they couldn ' t hear the tv which was turned up loud so that i could hear it over the blowdryer ! ! ! the second day , i called guest services to tell them that my tv wasn ' t working . after hitting N and waiting about N rings , i hung up . i tried again and had the same experience . i thought , what if it was a medical emergency and no one answered ! ! ! ! the handle on my toilet had to be held in order for it to be flushed . it reminded me of my old house ! i called down for toothpaste N minutes ago . i ' m still waiting . given all of the choices in a downtown area like this and with the tough economy , there have to be other hotels that provide better service . 
the keys to my cadillac cts was given to someone off the street by the valet company . valet authority inc . which the hotel requires you to use . i am out of pocket for the insurance deductible and the rekeying of my home . this happened on my wedding night no less . they have been no help and evidently don ' t care to help resolve my remaining issues . the general manager called me once and left a message never bothering to return my calls and talk to me personally . 
my review of the hampton inn will be a little dated , but it definitely deserves high praise . my girlfried and i stayed here in august N for N nights . this was both our first time visiting chicago . we couldn ' t have been happier with our selection . we picked this place based on the reviews on tripadvisor . com . thanks to all for their honest reviews ! if you ' re looking for a place with a great location , this is it ! it was very easy to navigate throughout the city from this loaction . getting to the hotel from the airport was easy as well . one train stop will get you block or two away from the front door ! don ' t expect a grand entrance , because there is none . what you get in terms of value is the location , service , and room quality . we also enjoyed the continental breakfast every morning and the free wireless internet inside our room . if you don ' t have time to sit for breakfast , they offer free travel snack bags . chicago in the middle of summer was quite hot , but our air conditioner was excellent . the bed was amazingly comfortable . we were well rested day in and day out . as for location , you can ' t beat it . it is so close to public transportation and is walkable to many major tourists sites . it is also very close to many great restaurants and shopping . next time we go to chicago , we will be staying here ! great job majestic inn ! 
for a large chain hotel with a lot of conferences going on while we were there my sister and i felt the staff was extremely friendly and helpful . when i arrived at my room i requested an extra luggage stand , it arrived within minutes plus extra pillows . the door man was very helpful and explained the workings of the hotel . the outrageous charge for wifi is so over the top , it is free at small chain hotels ! it is free in the starbucks down in the lobby . the room was large , the beds very comfortable , the bath was well supplied , and the linens comfortable . the location is great , close to shopping and good restaurants . 
the hotel is getting a little dated . the stetson restaurants still has great steaks and impressive service . my husband was on business and i tagged along . he left for a business trip early in the morning with all bags so i could go home on the train without luggage . unfortunately he took all my clothes . he left early morning and i slept in and found out i only had a silk shell for clothing . called the hotel shop and they only carry t shirts so i called the front desk . vickie came to my rescue with an employee uniform so i could get to a store and purchase clothes . even though i usually don ' t stay here i will definetly be staying here every time i am in chicago . vickie thank you again . 
do not book this hotel using an online site like hotels . com ! ! we booked a king bed non smoking for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary . upon arriving a very rude front deck clerk informed us that they " crowne plaza metro " did not have to honor our king bed booking because it was made with an online service and instead we were going to get a double room . if we didnt take it we would lose all the money . final in the room we find two small beds . im a big guy . so , to make a long story short . i spent my anniversary sleeping alone . my wife woke the next day with a rash from the detergent they use . ( we hope thats what it was ) so thank you crowne plaza metro for an anniversary that nether my wife or i will ever forget ! 
i travel often for business and stay at N-N star hotels as well as the usual marriott courtyard or hilton hotels . this hotel was great . i reserved the king executive which had windows facing michigan avenue as well as on the adjacent wall . we could not believe how quiet the room was-- no noise from michigan avenue or other guests , etc . amazingly and wonderfully quiet hotel room . the room was well appointed , huge , and immaculate . ( any hotel that puts stark white comforters on the beds has confidence in its cleanliness and i always take that as a good sign . ) the big surprise at this hotel was the dining . i almost never dine at the restaurants in a hotel at which i am staying . ( usually too many great other options in a city ) we had a case of the munchies upon checking in so we ordered appetizers via room service . service was quick , sharp , and the food was very good . the next day , we had lunch at the Nth floor rooftop garden restaurant ( outdoors ) which has a fabulous view and again , was amazingly quiet given the location of this hotel . the food was fantastic . we only ordered maine lobster roll sandwiches so we were ' t expecting an amazing culinary experience . . . . surprise ! the presentation was lovely and the lobster roll came on a platter with several " samplers " --- soup , cabbage slaw , homemade chips , and a sinful chocolate mouse cake . i ' ve had lobster rolls in dozens of places up and down the eastern seaboard and i ' ll tell you that this was the best , most flavorful , and freshest i ' ve had . the whole dining experience greatly exceeded my expectations . i would say that this hotel is a gem in the city and recommend it without reservation of any kind . enjoy ! 
N adults and N elementary-aged kids stayed for a N day , N night spring break . we loved the fact that our two rooms faced each other across a private alcove off the main hall . the rooms were very clean , beds comfortable and pillows large and fluffy . the tv was a new flat screen and there was an in-room safe . would have been nice to have a small fridge but we did okay without . the front desk staff was exceptionally friendly each day especially wallace , the concierge . the pool is rather hard to get too from the east end of the hotel and was chilly . no hottub . all in all , i would give this hotel N stars out of N . 
my husband and i just returned from the omni . we were there for just a N night stay . . . december N-N . since it was a holiday weekend , the hotel , and the rest of the city was jammed . our experience there was wonderful . we had a prompt and friendly check in . our room was very comfortable and clean . beautiful granite counters in the bathroom , pillow-top beds , and the living area were especially nice to relax in . i would encourage anyone who is considering a stay at the omni to join the select guest program they offer . it ' s free , and little amenities like juice and coffee delivered to your room free in the morning are really nice . we called on the concierge , both amiri and kevin , several times and each time they were able to help us and direct us to great restuarants , activities , etc . both were very helpful and amiri was kind enough to see that we got a wonderful bottle of wine or champagne on our anniversary . if when we return to chicago , i would most likely stay at the omni again , especially if we could get the same great rate . 
i went to chicago for a wedding and the wedding guests stayed at elysian . seriously this is the most amazing , outstanding hotel . my room was so luxurious i actually wished i had more time to spend in it ! i had a great living room area . the bathroom was gorgeous too with a great tub shower the tv in the mirror . 
my husband and i had stayed at the swissotel several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed our visit . we flew into chicago and rented a car to tour wisconsin before attending a board meeting there . we decided to spend the last night of our trip , on our return to chicago , at the swissotel for memories sake . we were able to get an outstanding lake view room for sunday night . though the hotel was completely booked , due to two conventions on friday and saturday nights , when we decided to stay an extra night on saturday , we were wait listed for that night . even though there was a mix-up with our original sunday night booking and it and our wait-list had been lost , upon calling back , the person i spoke with was able to confirm a wonderful lake view room on the Nst floor for both nights . once again we had a most delightful stay and thoroughly enjoyed the terrific view of lake michigan . our room was beautiful , extremely comfortable , and incredibly clean . perhaps my only complaint is the N per day parking fee , but that seems to be the norm for large cities . our two meals in their palm restaurant was another story . see separate review . 
went for a long weekend , a " last hurrah " trip before son N leaves for college . we are getting very spoiled and are leaning towards four seasons whenever it is a choice ( and when we can get a deal that is only outrageous , not astronomical ! ) although the hotel seemed almost N N empty . . . there were really no deals to be had other than the buy two nights , one night free . this would have been too expensive for us with two rooms , ( which is what we really wanted ) so we crammed into a deluxe executive suite , approx N night with taxes . . . ( and don ' t forget the N plus per night parking ! ) whew ! lucky that third night was " free " . but we knew all this going in so it is not a strike against the hotel . but what is does is set expectations extremely high . . . the lobby is beautiful , large , sunny , nice fountain in the middle . our room , on the Nth floor . . . . eh . . . . it had a main sitting room with a pull out couch , then the master bedroom separated by frosted french doors . it did have two bathrooms , but they were small and not " luxurious " at all , with combined bath shower . also , we joked about the " ergodynamic " toilets . . . they are kind of low , and rather tilt you backwards . there was enough room for the four of us , but tight when the rollaway was out . the main king size bed was extremely comfortable , nice fluffy bath towels and i love those four seasons robes . it was clean . oddly there was no tv channel information , that would have been appreciated . of course teen sons quickly figured out the remote to get channel listings , but my old eyes couldn ' t see it very well on the t . v . when laying on the bed . you can request newspapers to be delivered to your door every morning , which we did . we went down to look at the spa pool area first thing . it was unimpressive , to say the least . the pool is a small , very small lap pool . the whirlpool was small and didn ' t look very appealing at all , like not so clean , and not filled all the way ? as far as i could tell , it was not being cleaned at the time as there was no sign and a family was in it ! i did work out in their gym , and the equipment , for a hotel gym , was very good . nice touch to have cooled towels available and someone going around bringing everyone water . we did not eat at the hotel , nor did very many others by the look of the lobby restaurant every time we passed by . we did have coffee and drinks at the lobby bar , that was nice ( and , yes , expensive ! ) so yes , i liked this hotel , didn ' t love it , probably will try somewhere else in the future as for me , it did not justify the cost and have that " four seasons " feeling . it ' s not fair to compare a city four seasons to a resort four seasons ( like nevis , one of the most magical stays in the world ) but i have stayed at the st . louis four seasons , which was , to me , way more impressive than this one , and will be staying at the four seasons philadelphia in a few weeks , which my husband has already stayed in , and loves . i will then have a direct , big city four seasons comparison . 
got an excellent deal on hotels . com a few months back . rooms were stately and huge ( living room area with chairs and couch and separate dining room table ) . kitchenette with amenities . big bedroom with full bath and a half-bath between living room and bedroom . complimentary breakfast was tasty and filling . only N per night for a roll-away . elevators are quite slow , the only drawback . located near the lake and close to the magnificent mile . 
although i have lived in chicago for years and occasionally spend a weekend downtown , i was unaware of this little gem . the hotel is well-located to attractions , shopping , and restaurants . the decor is elegant and modern . the lounge area with the compimentary wine hour in the evenings and the coffe tea service in the mornings is a nice touch . we had booked a one-bedroom luxury suite and a double queen room for six women celebration a special birthday . one woman in our group is a frequent guest at this hotel so she was able to procure a very good rate . she also asked that special note be made of the birthday celebration and asked for wine and a small cake to be delivered to the room - not necessarily complimentary but to have these items available . by the day of check-in she had not heard back from the concierge and expressed her disappointment at the front desk . they quickly made amends by first , delivering wine , nuts , fruit , and chocolate-covered espresso beans . then at N , two excellent cheese plates were delivered . when we returned to the room after dinner , a small strawberry shortcake cake was waiting for us . we we also given an extra cot at no extra charge for the suite . the service , decor , and charm of this hotel will have me back for a repeat visit . 
i had my doubts about this hotel when i first blind booked through a third party site . the price was just a little too good and the location too perfect for it to be real . we breathed a sigh of relief when we walked into our room . upon arrival they " upgraded " us to a top floor , corner room and what an awesome room it was . we were staring right at the hancock building and lake michigan . for those of you planning a visit to the american girl store , you will be happy to know , it is half a block away and within view of the hotel . the beds were comfortable and not too small . the bathroom was very nice , updated and clean . the shower was a bit finicky but that is to be expected in an older building . and the room did have a slight musty odor upon arrival but that went away after a few hours - again , older building . the hotel staff was courteous and attentive . they were more than happy to point us in the direction of cheaper parking rather than pay for valet - they do not have a parking lot on site . there are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area as it is just off of michigan avenue . i would definitely stay there again . 
overall this hotel is nice . i agree with the previous reviewer who said the rooms are too dark to work . the rooms have no overhead lighting outside the bathroom and have just one lamp that is supposed to light the whole room , but does a poor job . there are three other lamps- one on the desk and two by the bed , but they are primarily made for reading , not illuminating the room . the exercise room was good , the staff was friendly . overall it was a fine hotel . my one gripe is with the room i was first given . it was room N . i ' m giving this just to warn others in case you get this room . there are very few rooms on the Nth floor , so i ' m betting the problem is with all of them . initially , i noticed that the room had two big spotlights outside the window that are used to illuminate the top of the building . i ' m sure it looks cool from outside , but it will force you to close those blinds ( therefore robbing you of your view ) because they are quite bright . not a huge deal- i just closed the blinds . the second problem i noticed was a banging noise that happened every minute or so . i ' m a sound sleeper , so didn ' t think it would bother me . but every N minutes or so there was a much louder bang rattling noise . it was loud enough to make me jump each time it happened . the first time i thought someone was breaking down the door to my room . i think it must have been noise from the mechanical room , which i noticed was also on the Nth floor . not being one to cause a fuss , i decided to try and deal with it . well , by Nam i was wide awake in my bed awaiting the next jarring bang ! i finally gave up and called the front desk around Nam and they were nice enough to give me another room . not sure what i would have done had the hotel been sold out because i could not have gotten a good night sleep with that noise . i can ' t imagine i ' m the only person who has had this experience with this room unless this was a temporary problem within their hotel . so my gripe here is that they put anyone in that room at all considering N of the population would have a very difficult time sleeping through the noise . so overall i ' d say it ' s a fine hotel as long as you don ' t stay on the Nth floor . or if you happen to notice a loud noise in your room , change rooms immediately . don ' t wait around hoping the noise will stop like i did . 
we stayed at the knickerbocker hotel from jun N-july N N . my first mistake was purchasing this hotel stay through hotwire , which i will never use their service again . don ' t get stuck at a place you can ' t get your money back . my second mistake was actually staying there . i can ' t believe they consider this hotel a N star hotel . whoever rated this hotel as such must have been drinking and smoking something . this is a solid N-star hotel . the rooms are extremely small and not well maintained . it ' s an old hotel so there is layer upon layer of paint on the walls and molding . at first we had a room with a queen bed , which gave us about N feet on each side . the bathroom door could touch the bed . only one person can fit in the bathroom . there is no place to put your toiletries because it ' s a single sink . the wallpaper was peeling in various places . then we moved to a room with a king bed . that was a little better a little more room . the decor was horrible . it looked as if they picked up the items from a flea market . now , the location is great . it ' s a N N block from michigan ave . , which was a plus . but , i do not recommend this hotel or hotwire . 
location was great for me , as my son lives around the corner ! nice little neighborhood area , lots of pubs , restaurants , theatre district nearby . i was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews , and our initial reception wasn ' t very friendly , as we waited for over N minutes for valet parking . couldn ' t seem to get anyone ' s attention to leave the car . but adter that , it was a very nice experience and i will stay there again . concierges were super , room was lovely and well-appointed . only complaint about room was the feather pillows- i don ' t like them , asked for firmer pillow , but the maid brought more puffly pillows . bring your own if you like a firmer one ! but the bed was very firm , super comfortable . cool-lloking lobby , friendly staff , good value for the price . i ' ll stay again for sure . 
september N , N this was the first time i was in chicago . this was a very good experience . we got there before check in and they let us get into the room early . if we weren ' t able to they would allow you to store your luggage in a locked room before and after check out . the room was clean . the beds were comfortable . it has a large screen tv with hbo . the bathroom had a coffee pot , coffee , cream , sugar and cups . the ice machine was close by with reasonable priced pop . the closet had a iron and ironing board . it also stated that if you didn ' t remember to bring you razor , toothbrush , toothpaste etc . . they could provide it for you . the pool and whirlpool was inside and clean and with towels . the free breakfast was outstanding . it had homemade waffles , scrambled eggs , bacon , sausage , muffins , bagels , yogurt , fruit , coffee , cereal , tea and juices . the shower head had many settings and they provided shampoo and soap . it had a desk and chair in the room with free internet hookup . i was also very impressed on how nice the workers treated you . i felt it was necessary to let someone know . pros swimming pool , whirl pool , free awesome breakfast cons couldn ' t stay longer ! 
first , we chose the doubletree for and extended chicago weekend because we wanted to be close to public transportation , and to the downtown area . in addition we were confident that the doubletree brand would not have any unwanted surprises . we were not surprised ! the hotel is located a few blocks from the chicago river and the boat rides and a few blocks from navy pier . the concierge was extremely helpful when we needed information on using public transport to oak park ( home of the flwright museum ) and the university of chicago ( home of the robie house ) . he pointed us to the grocery store two blocks away where we bought all day subway bus passes which proved invaluable . the room itself was comfortable and fairly spacious . no complaints here . the only downside , as is often the case with higher-priced hotels , is that in-room wifi is N a day although its free in the hotel lobby . on the first day , the service kept cutting out , and , on check out , i mentioned this to the front desk and was immediately credited ! the view from our room was great and the lake is visible from most floors . there is an einstein bagel store in the lobby which proved immensely popular in the morning . be prepared for a bit of wait . one morning we ventured in the hotel restaurant for a typical , over-priced , breakfast . while seated , we could not help but notice the frequent arrival of natives chicagoans , across the street in a place called the west egg cafe . the line soon went out the door . we tried it the next day , and are delighted to report it was twice as good and half as expensive as the hotel ! don ' t miss this place for breakfast . all in all , a good choice . 
i stayed here for a conference in late april N . i liked the view from the hotel ( river view from the room , but a fabulous lake view from the elevator area ) . the hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky , and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy . one of my colleagues had to ask to get his room moved at N am due to the noise of moving elevators . the beds were comfortable , and i liked having ihome to plug my ipod . while the lcd tv was nice , free channels did not contain any hd broadcast , and we all know how painful it is to watch sd broadcaston a hdtv . they also charge to use the fitness center , which seems quite outrageous . i also paid for the wifi access . 
i have previously stayed at this hotel and enjoyed it . i stayed about four or five years ago for my birthday and was really impressed . i felt then that it was well managed and well maintained , which is difficult for a hotel of this size and capacity . this time around , i was also impressed overall ( although not very impressed by the rooms , somewhat dated , although nothing major , and they are fine given that you dont spend the bulk of your time in chicago in the room ) . the hotel itself seems very well maintained and has a lot of amenities ( business center , a few restaurants , bars , great location on the river , pool , parking ( although a rip off at N when you can go next door , literally , for N ) and nice views . overall , for the price in chicago i would rate this hotel pretty well , and it should be noted that i am pretty picky when it comes to hotels ! this hotel has a great fitness center overlooking the river ! the pool is okay , i never understand why hotels have pools and not hot tubs . . . this hotel does not have a hot tub , that would be a nice addition if they did . overall the hotel is nice , well kept and staff seemed friendly . the one complaint i have is that on a sunday morning starting pretty early around N or N am , the cleaning staff were being particularly loud in our hallway . i thought it was a group of hotel guests and was getting seriously annoyed , but was extremely surprised to find out that it was the cleaning crew that worked for the hotel . that was pretty irritating . the cleaning staff we did encounter were really nice , but might want to be a little more cognizant of the fact that guests want to relax and sleep in on vacation sometimes ! also , the tub in our bathroom did not work , it was stuck on the shower setting , and when i tried to run a bath , the tub spout almost came out of the wall ( i meant to tell front desk but did not get a chance ) might be time for an upgrade to the rooms sheraton , otherwise , well done hotel , especially such a large property ! lastly , i must mention , we ate sunday brunch in the hotel and it was seriously awesome , the chefs who made our omelets and crepes at the create your own bars were so enthusiastic and fun , and the food was great , a ton to offer . almost as good as the breakfast buffets on our honeymoon in bora bora , which is a major accolade for those of you who have never been to bora bora . nice work on the buffet . again have to say the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful here ! 
we held our annual user conference at the allerton hotel . the staff is attentive and the hotel seems to have low turnover as we see the same faces year-to-year . the food is excellent and the rooms are small but well appointed . 
the people were very friendly , rooms were comfortable , clean and of modern european style . the location is very good . i would have given it a N rating but for the following N . close to a busy hospital ( ambulance sirens at odd hours of the night ) . N . one of the elevators was not working when i checked in on a sat until i left on a tues . had to use the freight elevator both times . N . had a smoke alarm battery beep at N a . m . ( just as i was falling back to sleep after an ambulance siren woke me up ) . the front desk did not have replacement batteries but she did come up to remove the unit so i could get some sleep . i would recommend this place if you are not a light sleeper . 
this is our second stay at this hotel . the location is perfect for anything you want to do in downtown chicago . the staff are all very friendly , the rooms clean and very secure . the complimentary breakfast is far more than just a danish and coffee . . . there was a nice selection of fresh fruit , yogurt , cereal , fresh waffles and beverages . the dining area was very clean . the complimentary high-speed wireless internet was a nice bonus . we will certainly be back ! 
we stayed at the hyatt for six days . their service was efficient and courteous . the room was new and clean . it was spacious and had two double beds . the room looked just like the picture of a double bed room on the hotel ' s website . we enjoyed a comfortable stay . no complaints ! the fan in the bathroom was running all night long and was noisy . i did not bring the problem to the attention of the hotel . the following nights , i simply closed the bathroom door so i won ' t hear the on going noise from the bathroom fan . the fan kept the bathroom dry . no moisture or fogged up mirror . the sleep quality rating i gave had to do with the fan noise . 
have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted . great bar ( draught stella and guinness ) which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there , good food , lovely staff , large clean rooms , comfortable beds , spot on location for the golden mile , joey ' s pizzas next door are fantastic . ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please . highly recommended
i was a little hesitant to book a room here after reading the reviews , but decided that the location would make up for any problems . a year ago i stayed downtown and was very unimpressed with one of the five stars . the reception i received was very nice . the staff at the desk were very helpful and answered all of my many questions pleasantly . they even did some investigation for me when i asked about a specific church ( where my parents were married N years ago ) . my blind father and i were given a rather nice room , and the bathroom was huge ! we had a small coffee maker and a refrigerator . the room was clean . the decor is definitely old , but charming . the beds were comfortable and clean . i was very pleased not to have feathers in the room ( allergy which i made note of on my reservation ) . we had many channels on the tv to choose from . we did not need to use the window air conditioner . breakfast was free . . . and , considering , not bad . it is a self-serve style buffet . if you want eggs , bacon , waffles , etc . , they were available , but you had to microwave them yourself . bagels , muffins , donuts , cereal , coffee , tea , juices , etc . were all there for you . the breakfast room was very pleasant and clean . the attending staff were pleasant . i accidentally dropped a whole cup of juice . . . they rushed over to clean up my spill and just would not hear of it when i tried to clean it up myself . fresh fruit was available in the lobby N hours day , along with coffee and tea . cookies were available in the afternoon . internet access was available . . . free connection in the lobby , a free computer also available . i don ' t understand why internet access in the rooms incurred a charge . all staff were aware that my dad was blind , and they were very kind and helpful when he was navigating the hotel alone . parking was right outside the lobby door , and a back-up garage was available if the parking lot was full . i did not need to use the garage . sadly , this hotel is scheduled for demolition in three or four years and will probably be replaced with something outrageously expensive . overall , this hotel was just what we needed . not fancy , but nice people , clean surroundings , safe , and in an excellent location . 
we come to chicago once a year for a romantic get away . the talbott is our favorite hotel so far . you get the same amenities as " bigger names " , but with a price that is very reasonable and a cozier atmosphere . location is great , staff helpful and friendly . i personally love a smaller hotel that is quaint and high quality . highly recommend for those looking for the same . 
room very comfortable ( esp . after long flight ) . reception staff most helpful to N strangers to chicago , and breakfast bar excellent . easy walking distance or public transport to everywhere we wanted to go . 
stayed here on a travelzoo deal and during the taste of chicago . we came from mi city on the south shore train as to save on parking fees , which the station is about N blocks away . the el train system is also very close N-N blocks to several stations . very good location for our use . N block from the river , our room had river views out N sets of windows . also a good view of the new trump tower and the intesection of michigan ave and wacker . the room was about as big as you get in chicago , with new stuff in all the right places , N tvs and a washer and dryer . . no frills but very nice and not up tight . only complants was the tv in the bedroom only got N channels , but whos watching tv in the bedroom in downtown chicago anyways , and also N of the N elevators didnt work for the first N hrs we were there , causing a wait sometimes . would stay and recommend for the average person not looking for N star service but wanting a N star room . 
great location , very clean , and helpful staff . what more can i say ? 
stayed there for a tradeshow . hotel lobby looks more like an airport or factory . i don ' t know if all the rooms were as terrible as in the east tower , but i asked N times for another room and N times i got the same poor quality the rooms are very old ( old carpet , yellow curtains , dirty windows ) and the bathroom hasn ' t been upgraded since a long time . although the view ( on the lake ) was great , the rest was just horrible the doors have an opening of around N cm ' s between door and carpet ( no need to say you have the impression to sleep in the corridor ) and the old airco systems had to be turned down because of the noice . the breakfast room ( hall ) is not cozy , the bar is nice but expensive . i ' ll never go back ! ! ! ! ! 
others have made most of the points , so i won ' t belabor it . . . but when i walked in ( wearing dress shirt , sweater , and khakis ) at Npm on a weeknight there was some sniffing that i wasn ' t dressed properly . nothing wrong with this hotel , but nothing to blow me away . and the snobbishness is unnecessary . my room had a lovely view of another indistinguished building N feet away , which isn ' t the worst i ' ve had , but was hoping for a better view given the building height . 
great hotel in heart of chicago for business or pleasure . rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large . flat screen tvs , marble baths , all rooms are suites , great desk , kitchenette , comfortable bed , free wireless internet . . . everything you could ask for . location is easy walk to magnificient mile and lots of great restaurants . staff is friendly and helpful . short cab ride to loop . 
arrived at the westin and was treated to a beautiful room with a view of michigan avenue . service was great and the location could not have been better - it is steps away from world class shopping , dining and many architectural gems . while all staff members were gracious and helpful , ashley stood out . she was so focused on helping making the most of my visit she referred my companions and me to a an absolutely wonderful restaurant . she also arranged for a slightly later check out which really helped me out and saved me time . the room and bed were very comfortable . thanks to everyone at the westin for making this trip so delightful . 
i can ' t say enough good things about this hotel ! we were lost in the parking lot and a very kind man pointed us the way out . he was the manager off duty ! a very sweet maid greeted us on the way to our room . the room was very nicely decorated and very quiet . at breakfast the next morning the room was packed but the staff was so quick and friendly the tables were ready right away . i would stay here again ! 
the hotel staff at front desk was super , the only reason why i did not lower the score more . xavier , was pleasant cordial both days . the lobby with the big pumpkins . . . lovely . they offer free breakfast , but i didn ' t try it . it is a close enough walk to magnificent mile , close enough walk to the gold coast , and wacker drive . down side , the little guy with the glasses the worked in the bar , i observed him being rude snotty to everyone . poor customer relations . my room , it was big , roomy , the living room area was nice , however the bathroom . . . uuhh the tub needed to be recoated , the toilet paper holder was stuck in a hole in a wall , with a piece of soap wrapper to keep it place , the view . . . a parking garage and i guess dumpsters . oh and if you need to go to the airport in the morning . . . . contact a sedan car service ! ! ! ! the under N miles to chicago o ' hare took N hour N minutes . . . and that is after the actual N minutes it took to get a cab to agree to take us , they would stop and ask , " airport ? " we say yes and they just drive off , really ? i was afraid i was going to miss my flight . we had to hide our luggage behind the planters for the cabs to even pull over . the nice door guy tried so hard too ! so what happened ? i arrived at the airport ( i was checked in online ) slightly under the N minutes to drop off my one checked bag , so i had to reschedule my flight to N Npm or beg to see if my bag would make it then hustle to my gate . i have been to chi N times . it is a lot of work and nothing to do but eat , shop , and go to museums . just be prepared . . . it is not as simple as nyc or la . imo
i arrived by taxi from the airport very late at night . the reservation was ok , check in without problems . the suite was perfect place to stay and work , good light , very comfortable bed and enough space for me . the small kitchenette worked well , restaurant offerred all i needed and the location is great for all downtown access . highly recommend to use this hotel . 
this was the Nnd best hotel i ' ve stayed in in chicago ( only Nnd to the hilton towers south michigan ave ) . prior to arrival i emailed the room coordinator and requested a two bed two bath non somking room and was granted my request within an hour ! no problems even thought we got the room for only N through priceline . this is a huge bargain rooms usually begin at just under N and can go up to N . all of the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and helpful . they never passed us by without saying hello . the lobby is magnificent and the hotel is located in an ideal location in the loop . just a N . N cab ride from union station . the room was exceptionally clean . the hilton beds are extremely comfortable . the wall paper in the bathroom was quite outdated but goes with the theme of the older hotel . the only other draw back was the bathroom mirror is small but we had two bathrooms so we had no problem getting ready in the morning , we were sad to have to leave the palmer and can ' t wait to go back . 
let me say up front that the swanky , loud , disco lobby was way not for us . much to much going on there , lobby restaurant was average at the very best . but , but . we got a great rate and our , room , bed and bathroom were among the very finest that we have ever stayed in . the bed was supercomfortable , the bathroom was spa like . in general the room had a feeling of relaxed elegance . we would stay here again despite the disco lobby . housekeeping satff was awesome . 
there was a group of N that travelled to chicago recently and spent N nights at the allegro . we all loved it from the friendly service when we checked in to the very helpful concierge . the rooms were small but fine . the location was perfect . we walked to the magnificent mile . . . to the sears tower and took a boat tour on the chicago river . i would definitely go back to the allegro . . . they also had a wine hour every night . very enjoyable trip . 
if you take a trip to chicago , definitely consider staying here . i have stayed in various hotels throughout chicago over N years and this was my favorite hotel because of the staff , location , and overall value . below are the highlights staff -- extremely helpful and knowledgeable . it ' s been a year since i regularly stayed in this hotel and the doorman remembered who i was . the front desk staff was efficient and courteous . we were flying in to meet family and friends so i just found danita ' s email and asked for her help . she was amazing and professional throughout the entire process . in a hotel with a thousand rooms she provided bed and breakfast quality attention . location -- perfect location to easily get around chicago . walking distance to some of our favorite restaurants ( volare , quartino , west egg cafe , yolk ) , navy pier , michigan avenue , and even a free shuttle bus to a casino ! rooms facility -- the beds were very comfortable and even better than i remember . they had just replaced them when i was leaving . the bars and restaurants in the hotel are convenient . 
we booked the american girl package . our cost for N nights for N double beds was over N dollars . our room was supposed to be upgraded , but did not seem that terrific to me . the beds were comfortable , the room was small and outdated . the bathroom was in need of a remodel . the room was a really standard room . there is an expensive mini bar , took some things out , to put some of my things in , ( then put their things back before we left . --nothing perishable ) we did get valet parking included , and a fold out bed for the doll , which my daughter liked . she also got some cupcakes and milk . this hotel is in a great location , you can easily walk to michigan ave and the all important american girl store . there is a mcdonalds in easy walking distance if you have kids . if i was able to get this hotel for N dollars a night , i would take it . but not for what we paid . just too expensive for what you get . there are other hotels in the same area , would check them out first . my daughter did use the pool , the pool was nice , but the air temperature in the pool area was stifling hot , no air circulation , so unless you were in the pool it was uncomfortable . i am glad we got an opportunity to stay in this hotel . it was fun to stay in the city . 
we stayed at the crown plaza for two days . the location was great , right off of michigan street , close to everything . the room was great , the service was great . the only advice i can give is to make sure you read the note on the refrigerator , if you store your own food in it you will be charged a N . N fee . . 
this hotel is absolutely brilliant . only stayed here one night , but everything was spot on . they had a courtyard outside of the hotel so you could relax in the cool september air and soak in the " hustle and bustle " of chicago . it was great ! ! ! i would recommend this hotel to anyone needing a nice and upscale place to stay . it ' s worth it . 
lovely remodeled rooms with two comfy lounge chairs . no flat-screen , but i ' m sure that will come . very friendly and helpful staff . trendy , good restaurant . reasonable prices and walk to buddy guy ' s and jazz club . a little far from the north circle action , but on a quiet street and easy access to the el or busses . large room . twin sinks are nice . 
i have stayed here N nights . if you look for an inexpensive place at a central location , then this is the place for you . the room is your standard motel room ( i booked on their website paid only N night ) , if a bit outdated . parking is free , and while i was there ( thursday friday nights ) finding a free spot was never a problem . also , i didn ' t worry about safety , as the staff are watching closely who is entering the premises . . 
the palmer house is located in the city of chicago , il . the rooms here are all first rate-although prices are high there are times when you can get great deals-during holiday seasons , and other promotional deals . the lobby of this hotel is unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! just sitting at the bar having a drink is an incredible experience . at christmas and before , the famous christmas tree is put up-really puts you in the spirit . 
stayed here over labor day N . had free hotel points to use . great location right off magnificent mile . walking distance to navy pier as well ( half mile or so ) . there are better hotel options but it served its purpose . small rooms , and hotel has some age . small hotel bar in lobby and coffee shop connected . very small elevators so beware . nice balcony on upper floor with great views . have to walk a little ways for dinning options , none onsite . 
this hotel is by far one of our favorites in chicago . then again how couldn ' t it be . . . every time you walk in the door they offer you hot cookies ! it is fun , hip and luxurious without any pretense . the view from the rooftop bar is wonderful ! plus it ' s location right on state street is amazing ! don ' t think twice . . . stay there ! 
this is a great hotel with some amazing views of the lake and the river . of course , with the building boom in chicago , you also get a view into several construction sites , quite fascinating . the room has all you would expect from a business hotel and the bed is to die for ! ! ! but i don ' t believe it ' s worth the regularly advertized price . . . so be sure to hold out for discount rates . while we were there the elevators kept malfunctioning , often leaving people stranded on their floor during the moring check-out rush . i was also disappointed that their shower product bottles were not recyclable , indicating a serious lack of basic corporate environmental responsibility . 
we booked a room on the N ' th of may for one night at the avenue crowne plaza in downtown chicago . the reason we chose this hotel was that it was a special occasion for us and we wanted to stay in an excellent hotel and the reviews for your hotel were good . but once we checked in , we were very disappointed with the level of service provided to us . the receptionist who checked us in , a woman named arta , was very impolite and did not even have the courtesy to give us a smile . we had booked the room using a friend and family quote and she made us feel as if we had done something wrong by using a coupon provided by your hotel itself . after booking the rooms on the internet we had placed a request the the rooms be close to each other and preferable on a higher floor as it was our first time in chicago and we would have liked a nice view . when we checked in , arta said she did not receive any request and gave us what was available . when we went to see the rooms , we were very disappointed . one of the rooms ( N ) were still ok , but the other one ( N ) was much smaller , dirtier and had a broken fridge . we went down to the receptionist and when we told her we did not like the room , she gave us attitude and said " whats wrong with the room ? its a nice room . " she offered us another room but it turned out that it was a similar room on a floor that was much lower than our friends ' rooms . so we decided to stay in the original room , even though we were not comfortable there . we were highly disappointed with the overall experience , from check in to check out . we spent extra money because we wanted to stay in the crowne plaza and experience a different level of comfort but after this experience , i feel we would be better off staying in a days inn or a motel N that would have the same level of service but at least a lower price . 
as others have mentioned , the location can ' t be beat . we stayed three nights , june N-N . hotel has gone down a bit since i stayed last year ( june N ) . i am a priority club member but didn ' t really get anything from the intercontinental to show for it , not even a newspaper outside the door . had requested a room with a view and thought it would be fairly easy since it was the weekend . the room faced a construction site so most of our view was of the cranes outside . don ' t know why they couldn ' t have done better since hotel was not that crowded . they did put us in a king-size , as requested , but the very small room made it seem quite cramped . other minor annoyances included a bathroom exhaust fan that didn ' t work ( steam took forever to dissipate making shaving etc . next to impossible ) and toilet that wouldn ' t flush unless you held down handle for whole cycle . another minor peeve was the very strict instructions from the pool gym attendant to shower before using the pool . i have no problem with this , but the pool was filled with kids and during the times i was there i didn ' t see one of them ever leave to go use the bathroom , so you can only imagine ! hotel staff were polite but not particularly accommodating . at checkout , they noted it but weren ' t too concerned when i told them bathroom needed some maintenance . i will definitely look elsewhere next time i ' m in chicago . 
chicago is gorgeous and there are numerous great hotels . the best is the peninsula . the location is perfect , right off michigan and in the midst of everything . the entrance does not completely portray the beauty of the hotel , as you leave your luggage , and take the elevator to the lobby level . then , it begins--a beautiful arcade hallway , leading to the concierge and reception , with a continental restaurant serving three meals and afternoon tea and the best sunday brunch . they also had a talented three piece jazz band on saturday night . down a flight is a top chinese restaurant , and in the building is a french brasserie . the decorating is absolutely first rate , and then there are the rooms . we were fortunate to get their N for N deal , and also an upgrade to a suite , which included a complimentary mini cooper with driver . the bathrooms are large and perfect , there is a dressing room and closets and drawers , and the beds and furnishings are comfortable and lovely . my granddaughter began saic , which is the art school attached to the beautiful art museum down the street , and i also met with specialist doctors at northwestern medical down the street . simply , a great weekend at a truly great hotel . 
the hotel is really well located for exploring chicago being less than half a mile from the magnificent mile and millenium park . we stayed in a king spa room on the Nth floor which overlooked the river and didn ' t suffer from the noise issues other people have mentioned . the room was a good size with a huge bath tub and separate shower . the staff were really friendly and helpful . there are some negatives though . housekeeping was a bit hit and miss with basic things like toilet rolls not replaced and one day the room didn ' t get cleaned at all . you shouldnt have to phone up and remind them to do these things when you ' re paying over N a night . the room is pretty pricey so you would expect it to have everything you need . however , toiletries in the bathroom weren ' t enough for N people and there was no bath gel provided which , given the bath is the main reason why you ' d book the spa room , this seemed a bit tight . the hotel seemed to charge a lot for things other comparable hotels would provide for free such as web access and bottles of water . also , there ' s a N restocking charge for the mini bar even if you just take one item out of it . we ate in the hotel restaurant and the first time our waiter was brilliant , very accommodating and helpful . the second time however the service was poor with the waitress bringing out our main courses N mins after bringing out our starters and trying to cram them on the table , and forgot to pick up our drinks order from the bar so we had to fetch them ourselves . didnt eat there again after that . it ' s a great hotel but for the price there probably are better places to stay . 
i stayed here when i attended a conference in chicago . the location is hard to beat , and that ' s about all i can say about this hotel . amenities and service were almost non-existent . no breakfast ( no restaurant , even ) , no free in-room internet , no fitness facility ( for that you need to pay N day and walk three blocks to the doubletree ) . i couldn ' t even find an ice machine ! i had to go to the hotel bar for ice . the bartender begrudgingly fulfilled my request for a wineglass ( " once i give these out , they never come back . " ) there was supposedly a part-time concierge , but one never seemed to be at the desk . my bed was comfortable , and the room clean and basic . no complaints there . the air-conditioner , however , was horribly loud and cycled on and off every N minutes . i could not run it at night and sleep . the bathroom was ridiculously small , and the sink placed so that it partially blocked the doorway . there was also mold on the wall and ceiling . i didn ' t have any problems with the check-in staff , and i found the bellhops to be very helpful . all in all , i wouldn ' t stay here again . 
personal trainer sam great people skills and training skills concierge dianne and lisa very helpful , housekeeping lady very nice - complemented us on our room
i would definitely recommend hotelN . it was clean , rooms were spacious nice . staff was friendly , our room was cleaned daily no matter what time we left . didn ' t have to wait terribly long for elevators because there are N for bottom floors N for upper floors . the hotel is very centrally located . only thing i would have liked is to have a fridge and personal safe in room . also very happy with purchasing in advance through skoosh , got the room we were promised at a good price ! 
i am a gold member to several different hotels including hilton , marriot so to say the least i spend a lot of times in hotels . i would rank this much higher than the top N in chicago . if you are lucky enough to get a river view you will be treated to a great room with a view , i am sure the other sides are good . the service is fantastic ! from the front desk to the concierge each of the staff act as if they own the hotel and want you to enjoy your stay . i cannot wait to get back and spend another night . also be sure to look for deals as this hotel does offer some specials from time to time . but even at their regular rates the hotel is worth it . give it a try . 
we have stayed at this hotel a number of times and remain impressed with the staff and service . although the breakfast line can be long the wait isn ' t long , the manager ' s reception is fantastic after a long day of meetings , shopping or sightseeing ! the rooms are spacious and comfortable . i will return again and again ! 
we stayed at the inn of chicago on two different trips . we were happy with our experience both times . the location is perfect for shopping and going to tourist sites . it ' s a great place to crash when visiting a great city ! 
this hotel met every expectation . we are " country " coming to a big city but the employees made my wife and i feel at home . we were close to everything around downtown chicago . this is a great place to stay and as usual , embassy suites was a Nst class place to stay . thanks you employees we will be back ! 
i booked this hotel by accident thinking it was as different one ( long and not particularly interesting story ! ) , and ended up very pleased with it . it ' s excellent value for money . my room was very large , with a separate sitting area with comfortable chairs and coffee table , and the sleeping area itself was also large , with a work desk . the room came with free wired internet access ( cabling supplied ) which was very much appreciated . the bathroom was also good with a large , deep bath . everything was spotlessly clean . the room was warm and quiet . the staff i came into contact with ( todd on front desk and sandra ( i think ) at breakfast were friendly , welcoming and helpful , which does add so much to a hotel stay . the price tells you that this is not a luxury hotel , but i think that you get far more for your money here than the price suggests . there are obviously frills you don ' t get , but they are really not an issue . there is no coffee maker in the room ( although there are water cups ) , but there is a cafe on the ground floor . frankly i ' d rather have it that way and get the free in-room internet access than pay the extortionate daily internet rate that so many more expensive hotels charge . the hotel is not central and there ' s not too much around it ( although i understand it ' s handy for the conference centre and chinatown ) , but there is a bus ( no . N ) which leaves for downtown directly opposite the hotel and drops you back off right in front of the hotel . it leaves every N mins , costs N . N for a single ride and got me from the hotel to the art institute in around N mins . i found it super-handy and it made not being located in central downtown a complete non-issue . as well as the cafe there is a restaurant and bar . i only used the restaurant for breakfast - warning breakfast portions are large ! i ordered more items than i could eat , thinking they ' d be much smaller . all well cooked . breakfast is ordered a la carte , rather than buffet , and is reasonably priced . i wasn ' t in a hurry , which was fine , but if you are expecting a dash-in , dash-out buffet option , you should probably leave a bit more time than you would normally . sandra was an excellent hostess . so , overall it ' s not a luxury hotel , but it doesn ' t provide budget-level service or accommodation . the staff is friendlier and more helpful and the rooms bigger , cleaner and better equipped than i ' ve had in many far more expensive hotels . 
our four days in chicago were great and the hotel was fantastic . everyone was helpful and very kind . our room was clean and cozy . it was a tad small but we didn ' t mind because it made up for the lack of space in other ways . we just had a fantastic time in chicago and the helpful staff made it more enjoyable . would book with them in a heart beat again ! ! ! ! ! 
just spent two nights at the james . loved it ! let me just say that the staff are outstanding . . . and that is the entire staff . the location is perfect for anything that you want to do downtown . weather was so nice that we walked down to the theatre district . . . nice N minute walk . just steps from michigan ave . lots of restaurants close by . ate at the hotel restaurant . . . . david burke ' s primehouse for dinner and breakfast . both times it was great - again the staff at the restaurant were outstanding . when we arrived at the hotel ( early ) they had a room ready . it had two double beds , but i preferred a king . . . . no problem - they gave me an upgraded room at no cost . great boutique hotel . this is the first time i stayed at the james - it will not be my last . 
breakfast the breakfast buffet was amazing , self serve hot line ( eggs , bacon ) and made to order omelets . N-N different types of donuts pastries . fruit was typically bananas , oranges , and cantalope or watermelon . pancakes with syrup or blueberries also available . cereal , yogurt , and granola also available . very impressed with food quality and selection for a free included breakfast . room living area of suite very spacious . rooms have microwave and fridge . bed very comfortable , pillows were the only negative - but they were pretty standard for hotels these days - down pillows that are very soft squishy where your head sinks into the pillow . service guest check in great job , also provided a free surprise dessert treat in our room upon arrival for my husband ' s birthday . concierge - not available after Npm . - ( we did not get much help regarding touristy attraction info - which seems like an everyday concierge request . we actually stopped in another hotel and received the help we needed . overall - despite negative opportunities listed we would definitely stay here again . the rooms were quiet and clean , bed very comfortable , breakfast was excellent and this was about N blocks north of the canal and N blocks west of navy pier . great hotel convenient location . 
i stayed at this property for N nights . it was centrally located in downtown chicago . the staff was warm friendly . i had a long trip the front desk made sure my room was ready when i checked it . the price was very affordable for a business person . would definitely stay again . 
the hotel had a couple things going for it including location ( only a short walk away from millennium park and navy pier , not terribly far from michigan avenue shopping ) , a courteous and prompt valet staff , and it was relatively quiet . beyond that i don ' t think it was worth the price paid . upon check-in they didn ' t have the type of room that i had originally booked . i wasn ' t willing to shell out more cash for an upgrade so i was forced to settle for a room that didn ' t really suit me . the woman at the front desk didn ' t seem very sympathetic to this and was clearly irritated by my inquiries as to why my room wasn ' t available or if they could do anything for me . also , while it was to be expected , any extras were steep . valet , room service , minibar , pool fitness center , and so on . i ' ll admit that i ' m not used to staying at nicer hotels but some of the charges seemed over-the-top . i suppose i would have understood if the hotel wasn ' t so underwhelming as a whole -- the lobby , the rooms , etc . everything was so bland ( design-wise especially ) , i really was expecting more based on the prices . on the bright side , the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nice ( a variety of toiletries were offered and the fixtures seemed newer ) . so , after walking around the city and seeing all the places i could have booked , i was pretty bummed . i ' d research all your downtown hotel options if you have time because there ' s plenty better than this one . 
i had a wonderful stay here and was surprised to find this hotel to be very glam . the bed was beyond comfortable , room service very efficient , front desk staff friendly and a great value to boot . and it is walkable to everywhere in the city . 
i booked our N night stay at the allerton through their website and got a king bed room for N night . i would suggest flying there if possible because parking is N day . ( most of the downtown chicago hotels have crazy parking fees ) N . great location - right in front of crate and barrel on michigan ave . seriously , for the price you can ' t beat the location . N . water pressure - not so good , but it is an older hotel . N . decor was very nice and the hotel was very clean . N . yes , folks the elevators are slow and hit or miss . N . new fitness center with new equipment on the Nth floor that has a view of the city . N . easy check in and check out - we were able to check in at Nam because our flight was early and we requested it . N . the biggest downfall of this hotel is the fact that you can hear everything that is going on in the hallways or your neighbors room . some dumb guy was talking on his cell phone in the hallway at Nam and i had to open my door and tell him to shut up because i heard every word he was saying . that was the most frustrating part of all . N . hotel restaurant is very expensive and not worth the price . check out bice an italian place right down the street that was fantastic and reasonably priced . overall - i would certainly stay here again but for only a few days . there is a walgreens about N blocks away if you are worried about snacks or pop . 
what a wonderful experience . my first stay at this hotel started after midnight on N N N . i had worked over N hours and just needed to sleep before returning to work early on N N N . what a pleasant surprise to find that the prior reviews were all on the mark . i was made to feel as a guest , not any easy chore for the hotel based on my mood . to be so well treated made the stress of the day disolve . there are many reasons this hotel is so highly rated . you owe it to yourself to stay here . 
if money is no object , then i ' d recommend the hilton chicago . however , most people would be concerned with such things which is why i don ' t recommend it . this is not an inexpensive hotel to begin with , but what you don ' t initially realize is that nothing is included . internet is not included , among other things , and parking costs N per day ! ! ! i believe there was cheaper parking in the area , but we checked in so late at night that we couldn ' t spend time searching . also , the shower was plugged up and drained slowly , the hairdryer was broken and the tv remote didn ' t work . just a lot of little things wrong with the room that you ' d think they ' d check once in a while . on the bright side , the staff was courteous and helped us with some of our problems . also , the hotel is very old fashioned looking , yet updated and clean . it ' s really a beautiful hotel . overall , i just have a hard time recommending it because of what you get for the money along with the issues we had . 
the allegro is in a great location downtown in the theater district ( next to the cadillac palace theater ) and just south of state street and millennium park ( on michigan ave ) . the lobby reception area is really nice and big and is a great location for their free wine tastings in the afternoon . they also give complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings . check-in was easy and everyone was friendly . we had a king premier room and we were a little disappointed paying extra for this room . the room is very large and very clean nice , but the bathroom is small . the sink area has very little counter space which is a rarity in downtown chicago hotels . the toilet and sink are also very close together . also , we faced a brick wall and had absolutely no view out of our windows . again , for a king premier that was disappointing . overall , i would recommend the hotel , but i ' d suggest not upgrading to the supposedly nicer rooms . granted , i don ' t know how small the bathrooms are in the less expensive rooms , but it ' s hard to imagine that they could be much smaller . there is a parking lot for N for N hours on the corner of randolph and wells ( just west of the hotel ) . i ' m not sure how much valet parking costs at the hotel , but N night is a pretty good price in downtown chicago . 
stayed here for N nights in august with mom and daughter . . . . room was very nice , no problems with housekeeping . we did hear sirens , but once asleep they certainly didn ' t wake us . concierge was very helpful ! ! room was very good sized and bathroom was huge ! location was N block off of michigan -- well within walking distance to many sites . got a very reasonable rate off of expedia . would stay here again ! ! ! 
the conrad is in a great spot , a quick walk to shopping , restaurants , the river and much more . it ' s quite nice , updated and xtremely clean . the lobby area ( on the Nth floor ) is open and has a good size lounge , terrace rooftop ( in nice weather ) and a restaurant . everything you need if you don ' t have time to venture out too far . the hotel is also attached to the mall across the street . i had a corner room that had windows on two walls . the room was huge , especially for a downtown location . ample space to spread out plus a comfy chair and ottoman , and a good size work desk . the bed was incredibly comfortable and the choice of pillows make a huge difference when trying to get a perfect night ' s sleep . the bathroom was also huge and they thought of everything in case you forgot something . on my last morning , i wanted to print my boarding pass and found they have a computer kiosk near the atm . icons for all the major airlines ready to go . they really pay attention to the little details that make things convenient and extra simple for their guests . i will definitely stay at the conrad again . 
our living social deal was a fantastic value already , enhanced by the friendly efficient service and lovely surroundings of the allerton hotel . check-in was quick , even though there was a line . the bell boys got us cabs quickly and our car was retrieved in N N the time we were told to expect . i love a hotel where the rooms are not cookie-cutters , and this was the case at the allerton . my only complaints were a noisy heating system when it cycled on and less-than-luxurious towels . 
from being greeted upon arrival to the outstanding service of the housekeeping department , and one housekeeper in particular ( irene mendoza ) , we were totally satisfied . had business meetings on the Nth floor which were excellent . 
we have tried many hotels in chicago all well located and comfortable . the westin michigan has the best location almost by the lake , right on michigan avenue by its best shops . we will definitely come back . hotel lobby is nice and comfortable , rooms were spacious ( for a big city ) and beds were heavenly . coffee in the hall in the mornings is a great touch . 
we took the train into chicago for a weekend of fun and found our accomodations to be absolutely wonderful ! we walked from millenium park train station to the hotel and found it to surpass our expectations . the embassy suites is N blocks from the center of activity on michigan avenue the magnificent mile ! the hotel is nicely centered with many eateries , shops etc nearby . the room was large and very clean , the complimentary breakfast was outstanding , including made to order omlets ! the breakfast was a great way to start the busy day and the managers cocktail get together was a relaxing opportunity around Npm before heading back out for dinner ! all of the staff members were very friendly and helpful . we enjoyed every minute of our stay ! 
i ' ve stayed in several different hotels in chicago . this was the best location so far . the rooms were clean and comfortable , i really enjoyed the clean and spacious bathrooms . the staff at this hotel were very helpful , especially the doormen . i agree with the other reviewers that at least a bottle of water should be provided and the wifi should be free for all guest . stll , i highly recommend this hotel because of its excellent location and staff . 
got this room on priceline for a pretty good deal . the rooms were a little dated , but clean . the bathroom is extremely small ! and as another poster has noted the towels are not the softest . overall though , we enjoyed our stay here , especially considering we got a good deal on priceline . the location is great for shopping and we were there the first week in december , so we spent alot of time on michigan ave . loved chicago and look forward to returning . i would stay at this hotel again if i got a deal on priceline , don ' t think i would if i had to pay full price . 
we had a gold coast package which included parking and breakfast and a room on the Nth floor with a partial view of the lake . the hotel caters to business people but we were there for a vacation . the hotel was quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable . the only quibble we had was with the heat---i suspect it ' s controlled from the the front desk even though they made a big deal about how we had our own thermostat ( it never responded unless i called the front desk --- it was november and would get cold in the room ) . it ' s within easy walking distance from the visitor information center and the bus lines . the hotel staff was very helpful and the onsite restaurant bar was fine for breakfast or lunch . 
when booking our stay with the fairmont , we requested an early check in , as we wanted to ditch our luggage and get straight to the taste ! we stepped into the beautiful lobby and we checked in , but our room was not quite ready . we were told we could wait , and they would call us on a cell phone as soon as it was ready . over an hour passed by , without a phone call . as the hour and a half mark approached we decided to ask about the status of our room . apparently it had been ready for quite some time and they had forgotten to call . . . ooops ! but we quickly got over the delay . the rooms were wonderfully decorated , with large bathrooms ! we also had the most wonderful view of downtown ! if you are looking for a nice hotel near both millennium park and grant park , this is a wonderful choice ! 
when we found a great deal via travelzoo for labor day weekend , we pounced on N rooms for our family . turns out it was not just a nice hotel but the staff was super friendly and the location was quite convenient to navy pier , millenium and grant parks , the magnificent mile , and plenty of other sites that we walked to during our holiday stay . we had asked for rooms near each other on the same floor but ended up getting adjoining rooms so that was awesome . we ate in the main lobby restaurant a couple of times in the morning ( for convenience more than anything else ) and though it was just a bit pricey the food was terrific and the breakfast buffet plentiful and quite tasty . my only nit-pick is the N day for internet - c ' mon folks , that ' s a bit absurd ! ! thank goodness the parking was free as part of our booking . i would stay here again in a heartbeat . great experience . 
i recently traveled to chicago with a friend to catch a cubs game . we originally made a reservation at the marriott o ' hare directly across from this hotel on the other side of the highway . we changed our reservation and stayed at the renaissance instead since the marriott had some construction going on within the pool whirlpool areas . the check in time was speedy and the front desk employees were all pleaseant and quite upbeat . the hotel has a very spacious , modern and inviting lobby area . lots of leg room and some really comfortable sitting spots . our room was unusually large in comparison to most hotels that i have stayed at within the same general area . the room was in very good and clean condition . the bed was very comfortable and the refrigerator in the room was a great addition to the ammenities and sure kept our beverages cold . the hotel has a really spacious swimming pool and a pretty nice whirlpool as well . my only complaint was the water temperature of the whirlpool was luke warm at best . i contacted the front desk and the temperature was much better later that day . it is nice to know that complaints and feedback do actually get taken care of quickly . well anyways , this hotel is extremely convenient for travel to see a cubs game . wrigley field is no more than N minutes away . the train station is less than a block away . it cost us N each for a pass to get us to and from the ballgame . the bell captain at the hotel gave us accurate diections by train and it turned out to be a great ballgame . go cubs ! ! i make sure that you check out ginos east for some super tasty chicago style pizza . it is across the highway and maybe a N minute drive . my only complaints about this hotel would be as follows . the hotel is off a main road and there is no sign at the roadway itself . we drove right past it . there is a dark colored hotel sign at the actual entry . however , it is somewhat challenging to read and did not appear to be well lit . unlike the other reviews , i expect and anticipate being charged to park my car at a hotel in the chicago area . however , the parking structure is incredibly busy at times at the spaces are unusually narrow . make sure that you are careful opening your doors . you don ' t want to hit the car next to you . i think that flat screen tv ' s would be a welcoming touch . thats it , overall beutiful hotel and really nice time to be had . my first time at a renaissance hotel and i will absolutely be back again ! 
great location . direct access to the mall . accross from joe ' s , one of the best restaurants in town . walking distance to blue chicago for great blues . 
this was a great hotel in terms of extra perks . . . i loved the hot breakfast in the morning and never encountered long lines . the manager ' s reception in evening with snacks and drinks was a huge bonus when i had to wait until late to go to a business dinner . the hotel is in a great location , within walking distance of great restaurants . the suite offered tons of room to get work done and relax . i ordered room service , it took about N minutes , but i enjoyed a hot and delicious meal . i utilized the valet parking in the basement , and was always able to get my car out quickly and easily . my only complaints were noise related . i was on the Nrd floor and the street below gets very busy and noisy early in the morning . i could also hear my neighbors through the walls . despite these setbacks , i would still stay here again ( but maybe request a higher room ) . 
my girlfriend and i had some time to kill so we decided to stay downtown prior to a long flight out the following day and enjoy some of the chicago flavor . i was a little concerned when the doorman was absent and i wondered if i ' d have to abandon the rental car at the curb to check in but another employee at the hotel stepped up and said that the doorman was detained but he would watch our car while we checked in . we checked in with no problems at all , dropped our luggage off and left to go see the city . we actually didn ' t get a lot of time to see the property and its amenities but the staff were very helpful and the room was clean . hope to come back to enjoy some of the other highlights the hotel has to offer , it seems to be very well kept . 
this is a historic hotel and the lobby is very nice - however , once you step into your room you realize that it needs major updating . the rooms are very old and not as clean as they should be . the tvs are ancient - for the first time ever , we didn ' t even bother turning it on . it was quite far from the beds and not a flat screen . the mattresses were old and flimsy . the whole ambience of the rooms was outdated and our room was very moist - the papers in our room even became damp . would choose a different hotel if you are staying downtown . they also charge you extra if you want to use the fitness center or internet . 
what a hotel treasure just south of the loop . the rooms are well appointed and the staff is extremely friendly and courteous - so much so that i was upgraded to a suite that was large enough to have a N-person party in . the restaurant was killer - i would eat there every night if i didn ' t have to meet business associates elsewhere . and the beer selection at the bar is one i have never seen - it is a beer connoisseur ' s dream . next time you ' re in chicago , make sure you stay at the hotel blake . oh , and did i mention that it ' s a great value , too ? 
we were in chicago on the night of may N N due to amtrak having service problems as our train was N hours late . amtrak provided us lodging for the night at the chicago south loop hotel-i was a bit skeptical since this was downtown chicago but from the time my husband and i walked in the door we felt welcomed . renee at the desk went beyond our expectations at making us feel comfortable . our rooms were very spacious and very clean . i was very concerened as we were going to have to book a flight to return home to alabama due to amtrak having service interruptions between chicago new orleans-our starting point on our N week vacation . i had never flown before and needed to purchase on line tickets for the next day . renee helped me with this process and even printed our boarding passes for us . again she exemplies excellent customer service ! thank you renee for everything you did for us . 
paid N for the night on hotwire . its your typical N star hotel . room was clean , a bit small . hotels in downtown chicago can get pricey so if you can get this hotel for under N i think you ' re getting an awesome price . 
stayed for N nights in april . features include big , clean rooms with comfy beds . very good bathroom and shower . very elegant inside and out . very good location , N-N blocks from bus routes . breakfast was the highlight for this trip ( really good omelette ' s ) . dominick ' s located across the street , walgreen ' s and wine store behind the hotel . need to improve remote control did not work and was never replaced ( complaint submitted on day of arrival ) , and the sofa bed was truly designed for small kids ( no adults should be allowed to sleep there ) . otherwise , an excellent option for chicago visitors . 
great hotel , great location . i highly recommend this hotel . the beds were super comfortable and the room was quiet at night . we had a great time and would stay again . 
recently went to chicago for N nights on a business trip . could not have picked a better hotel and location . i got a room for N a night on travelzoo which was hundreds of dollars less than other hotels in the area . the front desk staff and doormen were very helpful and accommodating . i felt very comfortable as a solo female traveler . yes , the rooms were a little outdated , but spacious , clean , and comfortable . its an older boutique hotel and had more charm than generic chains in the area . i requested a room at the back of the hotel which did not face the l train . it was very quiet . at the end of my stay , the airport shuttle came a little a early and the lady at the front desk printed out my boarding pass for me and ran out to the street to give it to me . . . if you read this thank you ! they really went above and beyond . i was thrilled with the value and the location . 
stayed here with our kids as well as my brother and sister and their kids N people and N rooms overall . our visit was on the weekend before christmas . the purpose was simply to have a family get together and get some shopping done on the magnificent mile . there is probably no location better in chicago for access to the m . m . nordstroms and the rest of the downtown mall is right across the street . that and the layout of the lobby , with it ' s large open bar and other common seating areas distinguished the downtown marriott from most other large city hotels we ' ve stayed at . it made socializing in large groups easier and the older kids could come and go as they pleased while the adults relaxed with a beverage . there were several large screen tv ' s and although this wasn ' t a sports bar it made it easy to watch the nfl game that captured the attention of many of the patrons . the rooms were small and non-descript . while the pool area was fairly large and accomadating , the pool itself was small . there was a good-sized workout room with lockers and showers available as well . we also received a rate of N . N which was a terrific value compared to their normal rates . all in all it was a great experience made better with the large , welcoming lobby , bar and access to all the best chicago has to offer . 
i don ' t ask for much when i travel , a clean room and a bed i fit in ( almost N ' tall and under N lbs ) . to make sure i always have a king or queen size bed i have it in my profile and double check my confirmation . i arrived at Npm and they put me in a room with a double bed . i was eventually able to get a king in a downsized room but they never adjusted my bill . still working on this . so much for being an elite member who plans ahead . . . 
the location of this hotel is super , the doorman and the bell boys were very attentive . the only minor is that you have to pay ( N , N N hrs ) for wireless internet connection . it surprised me as we stayed in various hotels motels during our N-week trip through N states in total ( including cities like nyc and boston ) but everywhere the internet was for free . no , correction at the motelN you had to pay N , N N hours . but hey , at a nightly rate of N , - what can one expect . for the rest it was fine ! 
my daughter and i went on girl s weekend shopping trip and stayed at avenue hotel chicago . we truly loved the hotel ! everyone was friendly and helpful . the location was close to fabulous shopping ( american girl place , disney store , chanel , boss , brooks brothers to name a few ) and great restaurants . we decided to get a kid-friendly room and we were so pleased with it . the room was bright and comfy and we had a ball with the wii ! we are planning on returning closer to the holidays and will definitely stay at avenue hotel chicago again . 
kierra , irma and patrick were all helpful and attentive during our family ' s stay . helping us and making us comfortable while we attended a family funeral . 
we stayed for two nights and were very happy with the accomodations . much better than when we were here five years ago . this time we had a remodeled corner room on the Nth floor with N windows and a view . the staff was efficient and treated us great . we would definitely return for a third time . 
i have just returned from N day stay at the bw grant plaza . i was initially concerned after reading some not so positive reviews . but if you don ' t have high expectations , i . e you don ' t expect the ritz carlton , this is great a little hotel in the windy city . i stayed on the Nth floor and had pretty decent views of the city skyline and lake michigan . the rooms were clean and adequately decorated . i was there for a conference and appreciated that each room had an ironing board and iron . the heater some reviewers complained about , worked just fine in my room . in fact , i had a brand new heater ac unit . connecting to the complimentary wi-fi was a cinch . only disappointment was the lack of breakfast . the restaurant next door was rather expensive . 
we stayed at affinia hotel for N nights in N rooms . it started with the warmest welcome by andre and peter and continued during the whole week . they were always cheerful and welcome us with a smile , they suggested the best attractions and restaurants . the sevice and stuff are the best we ever had even in more luxirious hotels . the food at the hotel restaurant is the best we had during the whole week . it is perfectly located for shoping and site seeing . we will stay at affinia hotel in chicago again . thank you for making our vacation a huge success . 
my wife and i were here for only one night so did not take advantage of any of the amenities in the building . we found our room quite comfortable , clean . and well-maintained . we heard some street noise but there was no sound from adjacent rooms or the hallway . the only problem was that the clock radio was set for an hour earlier and we didn ' t notice until morning . apparently it never got set ahead for daylight saving time last spring ( this is october ) . and i could see why--i could not figure out how to change the time and most likely no one else could either . as is the case with center-city hotels , extras are not free . you pay for parking , internet service , breakfast , etc . visitors should be prepared for this . also , expect to pay extra if you want a view because most rooms are going to face other buildings . and expect big city noise sirens , garbage trucks , etc . 
my wife and i arrived early on a friday and knew we probably wouldn ' t get into our junior suite which we picked because of the " l " shaped layout on an inside corner with tons of windows as depicted on the hotel web site . when we dropped off our luggage , we were told we were upgraded to a executive suite . when we checked in later in the day , we were checked into a handicap accesable room which had a bedroom and an attached sitting room with a fold out couch which is not what we wanted . we called down but were told the hotel was full and we couldn ' t be moved . later we discovered the phone didn ' t work next to the bed and to make a call , we had to go into the bathroom and that phone kept falling off the wall . the tv remote worked when it wanted to and a movie we rented had the sound so messed up it was like watching an overdubbed karate film from the N ' s . bose system and all . then the chain came off the toilet plunger as we were departing to dinner the second night at a very bad time . had to take the back of the toilet off and stick my entire arm in the toilet basin to get it to flush . i was not happy . room service was very expensive after all the fees were added and drinks at the bar were nearly N . N each after a reasonable tip . N . N is simply too high for a scotch and a magarita unless you are in st . lucia looking at the pitons and not a kid screaming in a stroller getting his diaper changed in the bar . and the hotel has no pool and it was perfect swimming weather . there are just better options for the same money and far better options for a bit more jack . keep looking . 
my husband and i visited chicago to celebrate our Nth anniversary and stayed at this hotel . hotel indigo is in an excellent location . it ' s in a nice quiet area but within a N minute walk of shops , food , and some great bars ! staff was polite , service was great , and the room was smaller but decorated in soothing bright colors . we got a great deal on the room and they even let us check in early without any hassle . parking was right next to the hotel for N N hours , which isn ' t bad for chicago , and the valet staff was fantastic ! only downside is that there is no pool , which would have been bit of a bummer for the kids , but there are plenty of kid-friendly activities to do in the area to keep them busy ! 
i stayed here in june N for N nights . good location just off michigan ave and across the street from the drake . room we had was small , but updated with very comfortable bed ! bathroom was nice with marble tile , granite counter ( very small ) and dual shower head with rain yet sort of pain to use . breakfast in the hotel is good , but takes a while so if you are in a hurry , don ' t eat there . you can walk to all of the good shopping on michigan ave as well as walk to navy pier . vallet parking a bit pricy at N bucks a night and it takes them about N min to get your car out . highly recommend you eat at joe ' s crab for dinner and gibson ' s steak house is a must do , but you will need reservations in advance . valore was also very good for some authentic italian cuisine , and try the wit for some good bar atmosphere . if you want to use internet , they will charge you per computer , not per room . enjoy ! 
the hampton inn majestic and staff can ' t be beat for a chicago stay - short or long ! for starters , there is the delicous complimentary breakfast and the comfortably decorated rooms that utilize perfectly this historic building . then consider the convenience of being within easy walking distance of the art institute the chicago symphony the majestic theater ( same building ) as well as several other notable theaters and endless shopping and architectural wonders ! for culture or for easy sightseeing , chicago is fabulous and the hampton inn majestic is in the center of all . finally , an unbeatable restaurant suggestion aigre doux which is a relatively new restaurant and will be well rated in the new zagat . if you ' re lucky , the talented chef will wander through the dining room and have time to stop and chat ! enjoy . 
this review is more about the parking garage than the hotel experience itself . our stay at the essex was actually very good for the price . except for our vehicle damage from the parking garage , our whole chicago experience up until that point had been nearly flawless . what a disappointment after checking out . it was noon on sunday just after walking back from a church service just a few blocks away . we were feeling great about chicago , and great about the day before heading home . the damage is on the bottom and side . . . looks like the valet driver had a smaller , lower red car and turned too close to my van when parking . gave my van a nice scratch and dent with the other vehicle ' s front bumper . we were so busy filling the back of the van with suitcases that we missed the damage until we stopped for food about N minutes out of town . we called immediately . . . had to wait about N days for the claim to go through . they didn ' t ask for photos nor did they ask for much information at all so we suspected we were going to be left high and dry . basically , since we can ' t prove they did it . . . we ' re on our own to flip the bill . and since , technically , the connected parking garage is a separate business from the hotel , the hotel won t accept responsibility either . with valet parking , this should have never happened . if driving into chicago . . . do not use their parking garage ! ! you ' ll end up paying for a lot more than the hotel room . not the way to end an otherwise great trip . puts a sour note on the whole chicago experience . 
stayed here on N N N . took our two boys downtown for a night in the city . sometimes when a hotel is hip , the staff can have a ' whatever ' attitude - kind of , ' i ' m too cool for you . . . . ' but not here . the modern vibe of the radisson is complimented by a welcoming friendly staff . our room was on the Nth floor - black onyx granite floors - with an bright aqua carpet . excellent lighting , top of the line fixtures . our room had a balcony , although it was too cold out to enjoy . wonderful views of navy pier and the lake michigan . beds were comfy - N queens , rather than N double - which is hard to find . one thing we noticed is the doorways to the rooms are not right off the hallway - they are tucked back - you go down a little hallway to the doors to the rooms . this makes the rooms very quiet . no noise from the hallways at all . being a new hotel , everything is shiny and in excellent condition . the lobby is beautiful , with the long ( very long ) fireplace and comfy chairs . the lounge , bar and restaurant are modern decorated in white , gray silvery tones . we had lunch at filini - the restaurant . excellent food . sandwiches were reasonable ( around N ) but the other options were pricey for lunch . ( N- N for appy , N and up for entree - most averaging N ) . lunch for the four of us was N ( we did have a couple glasses of wine ) . our boys loved the game room ( pool table ) and N N basketball court . the gym is better equipped than any hotel we have ever stayed . . . . but it is shared with the residents of the aqua building . we were there on two occasions , and it wasn ' t crowded . steam room and sauna are also available . we really loved this hotel . then again , it is brand , spanking new . i hope that they keep up with the maintenance of the property - keeping it fresh and clean . great location -- close to the river , millennium park . only complaint -- parking . N . ouch . goes with the territory of city hotels , i know . but it still gets to me . we will definitely stay here again . 
we booked three nights in this fabulous hotel through priceline . we had a one-bedroom " presidential " suite with a lake view for N per night including breakfast . car parking was N per night , but a car wasn ' t really necessary . the staff couldn ' t be more helpful and friendly . and the restaurant " mon ami gabi " was good too . 
had a great great experience at w hotel . while checking in , i thought the tone was friendly but also full of elegance , not too familiar . the gym pool are clean , quiet well equipped . the room was spacious , the view onto lake michigan absolutely fantastic . before leaving , i wanted to buy stamps for post cards , they just took them and offered to stamp them , free of charge . i highly recommend this hotel
i was glad to be staying at the w city center instead of the usual place in chicago , as i had heard good things about the hotel . turns out there was good and bad , as follows good things included the beds ( very comfortable , although small ) , linens ( nice from the towels to the sheets and comforter ) the bliss bath products ( dreamy and lovely - i usually don ' t take the products anymore because i travel so often , but i took these ! ) , the shower head ( great water pressure ) and the personnel , who were almost all polite and cheerful . bad things included tiny tiny room ( barely could walk around in the room and the bathroom gave new meaning to the word small ) , dark furnishings which made the room seem even smaller ( expecially the dark gray , wavy drop ceiling - what ' s up with that ? ) , the woman who yelled at me during the wake up call because she couldn ' t hear me ( the phone was broken ! ! ! ) and the ridiculous cost of cocktails in the lobby bar ( N . N for a small glass of house wine and a martini ! ) . all in all , for the price paid i prefer the old standby of the allegro , which is less expensive and closer to the office where i work . 
enjoyed this hotel immensely , possibly the best and most accomodating staff of any hotel we have stayed at recently . checked in for new years eve for N nights , we were given a corner room , nice size comfortable but a bit noisy from some outside fans . contacted the front desk and they responded immediately , personally came to our room to show us another availability and moved us to a beautiful suite overlooking harry carey ' s . everyone went out of the way to make our stay comfortable and arrange dining and theatre tickets . they work closley with harry carey ' s and walked in without a reservation at N N pm new years eve , gave them a card from the hotel and we were seated immediately . tuan the bellman , joe , chris and george at the front desk were wonderful . the evening cocktail party had great food and beverage selection , the morning continental breakfast on each floor had great selection as well
i booked this hotel with a tip on deals from the trip advisor forum and got a good deal . . . after reading the reviews ( and seeing and hearing the house of blues as i arrived ) i asked for a high floor and a quiet area of the hotel . . . . i was on the Nth floor in a great room with a view of the river , the marina towers and N wacker drive one of my fav buildings in chicago . . . very convienient for my evening at the oriental seeing hair . . . and for viewing the green river on st patricks day ! ! i had a problem . . . my toilet overflowed . . . and the response was quick and clean up promt and thorough . . . . i think this is where you find out if you ' re in a good hotel with good service ! loved this hotel ! ! i
we were offered this hotel when booking our flights with travelbag . the cost for three nights over and above buying flights only was only N - how could we go wrong . however , then we read the reviews here and elsewhere and started to worry . . . . we needn ' t have . yes , rooms are not large - but not tiny and hey , you are only staying a few nights , not buying the place . bathroom very tiny but clean and with all facilities . air con worked well - good as it was cloudy but very warm and humid . room was clean and no funny smells . we are quite sensitive to tobacco smoke but didn ' t notice any in the reception hall at any time . all staff pleasant and helpful . didn ' t eat at the hotel as it was a bit pricey compared to other places . our only gripe with the hotel - and it is a teeny one , was the gift shop ( i think independently run ) where there were no prices displayed . my husband selected three postcards and they wanted N - when they were around Ncents each elsewhere this was over the top . recommendations in chicago ? l ' appetito at the bottom of the hancock tower for breakfast and also good lunches . the bean in millennium park for an interesting sculpture . hancock tower bar has good bar menu and great to watch the sun go down and all the lights come on - must be as good a view as the top floor and you don ' t pay admission ! use the ladies loo on this floor ( girl ' s only of course ) and see the most amazing view from a loo ever . potbellies near the sear ' s tower is good for lunch ( closed saturdays ) . free trolley bus rides around the city are good - but make sure you get on the free ones as some charge . navy pier great and the lake beautiful . airport shuttle not as good as other cities - pricier than a taxi for more than one . taxi was around N each way . 
my husband and i just returned form the most wonderful week at the sofitel chiago ! i just re-read many of the other reviews posted , so that i can address issues directly , and not waste everyone ' s time - bathrooms are as amazing as everyone says . great products , space , luxury upfittings . - staff was amazing with customer service , while not being at all " snooty . " - conceirge was one of the best that i have ever dealt with . " brian " was a star and should be promoted ! he was like an old friend , pointing us to great restaurants , and gently guiding us aware from the tourist traps . - room was modern , clean and comfortable . small , but perfect in every other way . i choose perfection over space . - stop sitting on the fence . book the sofitel water tower ! we are in new york just before christmas , and are staying at the sofitel there . can ' t wait to see the sister property , and this time in a suite . this may be the beginning of a long and loyal relationship ! 
had a N night stay in kingsize room on Nth floor with veiw of magnificent mile and watertower . no problem with elevator waits but never could get connected to web . got a decent rate with groupon deal . location was ideal . reasonable walking distance from the subway system with N connection from airport ( a N day pass was great deal for everything we needed and prevented high parking prices ) . lots of places close to eat . we were trying out the chicago pizza ( it is good as pizza always is to me , but not anything super special ) . walgreens in same block . very enjoyable stay . especially recomend the mayors office sponsored free tours with volunteer greeters . nobel horse theater was unusual fine in downtown chicago to those with equine interests . lots to do--will go back in warmer weather next time . was nice for us floridians to have one day of snow though
my wife and i recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the drake on a pleasure trip to chicago . aside from the " chamber-of-commerce " view up the shore of lake michigan from our fifth floor room , we made numerous visits to the concierge desk , relying on the extremely helpful and engaging staff . we made our first contact with them via cellphone , enroute to chicago to get some ideas about recreational opportunities in the central part of the city . without hesitation , andrea suggested taking a chicago river architectural boat tour . it was a perfect choice for us to spend an afternoon catching up with old friends and learn a great deal about chicago in the process . they also suggested two top notch restaurants for us , one for an early dinner before going to second city on friday night , another for an excellent italian feast on sunday . the drake is a fine old hotel with a lot of charm and history . our stay there was made nearly perfect by the hard working , friendly concierge staff . kudos to them ! 
my spouse and i needed to move out of our home for N hours while it was being " spring cleaned . " this year , we selected the hilton because they welcome dogs that are up to N pounds . our large , male airedale is over N pounds - so , he isn ' t allowed in most " dog friendly " hotels . at the very last minute , we booked a one-bedroom suite on the Nth floor ( executive floor ) . the entire experience at the hilton was excellent . from the moment that we arrived , the staff was very accommodating - especially to our dog ! they made sure that oliver had a dog bed , bowls , treats and lots of attention and praise . they even offered to walk him in the park across the street ! the suite was updated and since it was a corner ( south east ) suite , we had windows on two sides - very nice - lots of light . the bed was comfortable and well appointed with plenty of pillows . room service was very good - we ordered dinner at Npm and at N Npm it arrived , hot and well prepared . breakfast on the executive floors was excellent - nice options ( including " take away " coffee cups with lids ) and very friendly and helpful service - especially the concierge . overall , we were pleasantly surprised - we didn ' t expect much since it ' s the " old hilton " - and , since we just needed a night someplace that welcomed our dog , our expectations were pretty moderate . hilton greatly exceeded these expectations - we would highly recommend this hotel to families with kids or dogs - the hotel staff goes out of their way to make sure that you ' re welcomed . finally , i have to say , the common areas are beautiful and very grand ( especially the front , N story entrance ) . with the very reasonable rates that hilton is charging this summer , you can ' t go wrong - especially if you ' re from out-of-town - the location , across from grant park , can ' t be beat ! p . s . - be sure to check and see if you can upgrade your room rate by N night to allow for indoor , attached parking ( the usual rate ( if you don ' t include it in your room rate ) is somewhere around N night ! ) . 
ok , i have traveled extensively for N years . i have stayed in hotels from nyc , to paris , to copenhagen , etc . this summer is i stayed at the james for business . my company put us up at the intercontinental , but we have stayed at the james in the past . i decided to buck the system and pay extra to stay at the james . i checked two bags on my last day while i still had business at the mart . after meeting clients for drinks in the hotel bar , i went to get my bags . my bag with my ipad , an hermes scarf , my daytimer , gifts for my kids , hair straightener and various other items was gone . total loss about N . N . the desk clerk and hotel manager assured me that they would replace the cost of the items . they told me to wait a week and the bag might turn up . after a week i called the manager and he pushed back saying the chicago inn keepers law only holds them liable for about N . N . after getting very upset and making a stink the hotel agreed to pay N . N , a loss to of N . N . i will not return to the james . i had previously left a sweat shirt and pants in the room that they claimed they did not have . 
just returned from a three-night stay at the wyndham . everything was perfect , from ismail at the front desk to dennean ( the by request manager ) . our room was wonderful , the daily breakfast included in our package was excellent , my kids had a blast , and the service was friendly . i can ' t recommend this hotel enough and we ' re already talking about our next return . you also can ' t beat the location of this hotel . yes , there are sirens as the hotel is across the street from a hospital . however , we were on the Nth floor and it was definitely tolerable . it ' s a city . . . cities are loud . we dealt with it . basically , don ' t let that detour you from staying here . and , if you ' re not happy with something , don ' t hesitate to ask . i can honestly say that this is by far the friendliest hotel we ' ve stayed at in chicago . every employee we talked to was kind and acted like they truly cared about their job . 
we were impressed by our room at this hotel . wood and carpeting , rain shower , reasonably priced minibar , large windows , ipod dock sound system , plasma tv , hyper comfy sheets , so perfect but . . . saturday night arrived and the party started . they have a very popular nightspot at this hotel and clients that go there during their stay . so they have to guard the elevators on saturday night because there is a lot of people wanting to cut the line outside and use the inside hotel elevators . and i think that the hotel ' s clients can go back to their room from inside . . . so there was noise all night in our corridor , culminating at N N am ( we went to bed at Nam ) when a group of people arrived and spent N minutes in the corridor shouting and laughing . at some point i went to open and close my door with a bang to make them realize they were in a hotel . they shouted insanities at us through our door and continued their noise for N minutes then came back to knock violently at our door . earlier in the day another client complained to us in the elevator that the night before two men came out of the elevator at the same time he did and followed him to his room . . cautioning us to be careful . i am sorry to think and say that this hotel management ' s want to make money and be hip with a trendy nightspot at the expense of the comfort and security of their hotel customers . i will not go back to the dana for that reason only
i am in total agreement with the poster below regarding this hotels front desk service and elevators . we stayed during the same weekend and it took us over an hour to get from our room to the front desk and vice versa . when we finally did make it down we were charged for things from the mini bar we never used along with being double charged for our room at a rate higher than our original rate ! we discussed it with them and they " took care of it " later that week i found that the charge was again taken from my account ! after dealing with the billing department it has now been refunded , we will see for how long . i have stayed at many chicago hotels with my wife for pleasure and business and needless to say we will not be back . it was like pulling teeth to even get an apology from the staff for their errors . 
we just got back from a fabulous weekend stay at the w city center . we booked the w because it was close to the christmas market at daley center . the w was a short N block walk . i was a little leery when i first walked in with my N year old son , it looked young , hip and funky . however , there were wooden chess sets , connect four and checkers games sitting out even hot chocolate at check in . the rooms were spacious , clean and comfortable . there were a couple of small broken things but the staff was very apologetic and very attentive at getting them fixed . the shared spaces in the lobby is comfy and fun . a great alternative to being stuck in the room . one night we decided to go down , have a drink and play some chess . my son was sad because all the games were gone . i asked at the desk and they said someone threw all the games pieces together and they sorted through all of them so he could play . amazing customer service . the restaurant is nice and has great food . they were also very accommodating to my son . there is also water and coffee for free in the mornings , and cookies out in the afternoon . also plenty of options right outside the doors . but i cannot say enough great things about the staff ! thank you for such a wonderful stay ! 
i stayed there over halloween weekend with girlfriends and thought the hotel was fine . it was a large hotel and very busy due to its location . i liked that they had coctails for the guests from N-N , that was a nice touch , it was a small area that was packed , but it still was a bonus . the rooms weren ' t fancy , but they weren ' t bad . they were suites and big enough with a table . we ordered carry out from the resturant downstairs which worked out really well because we just wanted easy snacking and sharing and didn ' t have to buy drinks this way . the breakfast was not up to my standard . it too was crowded , and i may be a food snob , but after attempting a completley dried out omlet , cooked for N minutes ! i went for oatmeal , and that was terrible . i liked the coffee and had a banana . i understand food for the masses can be hard , but maybe less is more would bring up the quality . the lobby was pretty for the fall , the people at the front desk were nice . the other thing was the garbage . because it seemed to be a party hotel , there were pizza boxes and garbage bags everywhere , and all night and then next morning they were still there . . . maybe a few more on the overnite cleaning staff . 
the hotel burham was a welcome refuge from the bustling big city of chicago . with it ' s smaller size , beautiful renovations , comfortable rooms , excellent location and exceptionally pleasant , professional and helpful staff i would stay at the hotel burham again and recommend it to other travelers with no hesitation . this is ritz carlton treatment at prices the ' average joe ' can afford . two thumbs up for the hotel burham ! ! 
check in is not the greatest with the front desk clerks unable to crack a welcome smile while they sat at a low desk and did not even offer us a seat while we " stood around " waiting to check in . the dana is in a old renovated building . the reception is on the first floor and so you have to walk up the stairs or take a single floor elevator , cross the lobby just to get to the elevators to your room . we got a large king size room which was nice but with floor to ceiling windows it was a bit of an effort opening and closing around N blinds every morning and evening . the bathroom was a bit of a strange design with a glass panel which gave the person in the bedroom complete access to anyone using the " facility " . there was a curtain which you could leave open or closed across this glass panel , but still a very odd design feature . the location is good with easy access to a lot of local attractions and nearby restaurants . the gym is well equipped with new machines . unfortunately i did not have a chance to use the spa but it looked very nice . the metro station is located a few blocks from hotel which is really convenient and easy to use . we took a train to and from airport to avoid traffic which gets congestive . free easy to use internet access in room . the restaurant on first floor had a club atmosphere at night but sound is well contained . overall we had a good stay , but reception staff can definitely use a motivational talk . try get room on higher floor for a better view . 
we came in from the chicago suburbs for an activity in the city . the hotel was just fine for N of us . we appreciated the room safe . our room was in the back by the alley , but inspite of reviews that this was a bad location , it was actually quiet and probably better than the side with the " l " going by all the time . a panera is only a block north and west , so breakfast was easy to take care of . subway is across the street for a quick lunch , and lots of more eating choices of all prices are within walking distance . hotel a bit tired . the staff was nice . room clean . we were on the third floor so walked up and down as the elevators were a bit slow in showing up . we did not use parking as we used public transportation in and out of the city . overall i would stay here again . 
overall an excellent hotel in a great location . . the staff were very friendly and helpful . the concierge desk was excellent in assisting with information on the city and obtaining reservations . the room was very comfortable and clean . if i had to pick one minor thing to complain about we found the quality of the toilet paper not very good for a hotel of this standard . it may have something to do with the hotel or city plumbing . . apart from that a great chicago experience
as co-producers , we went to chicago with a small group from hartford , ct to see the opening of the new musical " the addams family " . it was cold in chicago that day but from the moment we were greeted at the door of the wit hotel we felt a warm welcome . everyone , from the doorman , concierge , room service , dining room staff etc , was personable , helpful and polite . even the telephone operator addressed us by name , the design of the hotel is stunning , both high concept and user-friendly . the room was spacious , clean and comfortable and the price was very reasonable for the quality . eds , west hartford , ct
definitely excellent ! our experience was not lacking in any way . my husband and i stayed at the end of march for two days . the room was excellent , very roomy , up to date decor , clean , very much up to international standards ( i ' m american but live in new zealand ) . service was great , atmosphere wonderful , i loved the selection of menus from local restaurants that you can order from and have added to your room tab . i appreciated the mini kitchen , i think that ' s something sorely lacking in american hotels and motels . we didn ' t eat at the restaurant on the premises so don ' t have comment on that . one reviewer had issues with the air conditioning the info binder in the room did mention that they turn off the heating air conditioning while you ' re out for the day , to save energy , but that can be left alone upon request , and our room had its own controls . the price was excellent , especially for what we got . and if you ' re into downtown chicago , the location doesn ' t get better than this . i feel like we got to experience a little bit of authentic chicago , not just another corporate cookie cutter hotel . next time i ' m in chicago , i ' m definitely going to book this place again . in short , no shortcomings in my opinion and i can be pretty discerning . 
i have literally traveled the world and this was by far the smallest room i have ever stayed in . the claim to N stars is laughable . the bathroom is a joke . it is so small one cannot even turn around in it . there is no mini bar , no coffee maker , no place whatsoever to do anything more than lie in bed . the tv is so close to the end of the bed that i had to sit on the bed to squeeze between them ! the pool closes at Npm , the gym costs a supplement , the ethernet cable costs N for the very basic reception , and the line at the hotel ' s reception desk is enough to turn you away . if you want to stay in a small and expensive N star hotel in downtown chicago , then this is your place . if you desire nicer accommodations , then by all means , keep searching ! ! 
i spent one night at james hotel traveling through chicago . it turned out to be my best hotel stay ever ! finally a hotel that has found the perfect balance between extremely friendly staff ( genuine and service- minded ) great rooms with modern style , excellent food ( breakfast is highly recommended ) and a perfect location . 
friendly hospitable staff , chic modern decor , great location -- N min walk to shopping on magnificent mile millennium park and it overlooks the chicago river . sign-up to become a kimpton member ( it ' s free ) and you ' ll get a discount on rates along with free wi-fi and a N credit to raid the mini bar when you check-in . also , if you become their friend on facebook , you ' ll get a complimentary bottle of wine and a sweet note . you get comfy animal print robes to wear , aveda products , an umbrella in case of rain and if you get lonely , they ' ll even bring up a goldfish to your room . concierge was friendly and gave us great suggestions . spend a little more for one of the corner rooms with the two large window seats that overlook the river . . . you won ' t regret it ! 
this es was in a good location and close to the central area of chicago a quick drive over to the navy pier although i suppose you could walk if you like . we were lucky enough to stay in the presidential suite on the top floor which was a great choice for our family of N . one bedroom had N double beds and the other had a king bed and there were N full baths . there was also an ample living room with a large l shaped couch and a very nice wet bar with a large dining area . N total flat screens . nice space . the service there was also very good . their daily breakfast area would get crazy busy everyday we were there . as would the afternoon happy hour . be there early or you ' ll have to fight in the lines or miss out . i would recommend this hotel for families . 
modern style rooms with balconies that expose the guest to great views of lakeshore east park . staff extremely accommadating , friendly and professional . fitness room enormous with lot ' s of options . rooms were squeaky clean ( including bath ) . very reasonable rates for this newer hotel in a great location . 
i travel to chicago on business at least bi-monthly . the affinia is always my hotel of choice . the location is perfect , the rooms are spacious and modern , the roof top bar is an oasis , c-house restaurant is fantastic , and most of all the staff is outstanding . the bell man welcomes me by name , the front desk is efficient and accomodating , the servers are terrific and everyone goes above and beyond to ensure i have an enjoyable stay . i reccommend this hotel with great enthuisiam . it truly is my home away from home in chicago . 
this hotel is very nice . my wife and i spent our anniversary night here , t is right in downtown chicago and there are lots of places to go nearby during day and night . the staff is very knowledgeable and the concierge desk knows just the right places for you to go . it is a high end hotel so nothing is free which is a change from the usual hotels i stay at but the prices weren ' t bad . the rooms are older looking but it is an old hotel and the decor and comfort make up for it . great place to stay when shopping or enjoying the nightlife in the city ! 
hotel is in a great location . lobby is nice . workers are great . the rooms are extremely small and tired . carpeting , paint , bathrooms are in bad shape . rooms need complete renovation . . 
the hotels locaton is wonderful , but the rooms are tiny . i have never seen hotel rooms this small in the united states . the hotel is in a beautiful historic beaux arts office building , but the room have the charm of a dorm . the bathroom only had a shower and the closet was the size of a phone booth . the television is too small to see from the bed . the bedding was cheap . room was very clean and in excellent condition . elevators were very slow and required room card to operate . the sheer size of the room made it difficult for two people to share . staff was very accommodating . 
nice hotel , good location , view from the Nth floor wasn ' t up to much but we were on a freebie so didn ' t complain . room was large and clean and bed comfortable . woman behind the desk wasn ' t that friendly or competent . it took a while to check in and i had to come back down as the key card didn ' t work first time . 
fifteen of us travelled from ireland and had the greatest pleasure of staying at the affinia ! the best hotel in chicago without a doubt ! irish people are known for our friendliness and hospitality but we have major competion here ! what a fabulous bunch of people and if i can , i will mention names , victor , daniel , erin , christopher , joel , they made our stay so unbelievable ! thanks in particular to victor who put up with our midnight antics , that is finding our keys etc , the affinia should open a hotel in ireland , we need a great hotel like it ! please let us know if you do as we ' re all in the business ! ! nicest staff you will meet , if you ever visit ireland we work in a restaurant called the oar house in howth co dublin . come visit xxxx ps victor you made our holiday love to yaxxx
popped in for weekend get-away . room obtained via hotwire . very impressed with size of the room bath . well appointed , big flat screen tv plus bose stereo , comfy bed . in the past have stayed on michigan ave ( intercon , drake ) , this location puts you in the heart of the shopping district with lots of amenities nearby . public garage across the street , valadation gives you N per day rate ( vs . N ) with in out privliges . they , like many , have gone to the free coffee in the lobby vs in-room machines - which i like as the joe is usually of better quality . only negative is no-pool , the intercon may get the nod as they have a great one ! 
my three daughters and i chose to rendezvous to chicago from boston , tucson , and co for our " girls weekend . " arriving at the " w " there was no welcome or help with the door or luggage , their lobby is a " cheap " cocktail lounge , the rooms are extremely small , furnished very distastefully and even our requested upgraded room overlooking lake michigan was a joke . the only positive experience was their concierge s understanding and willingness to help us relocate to the drake hotel . with only a few short days to share together in the exciting city of chicago , we lost half a day and months of battle fighting for reimbursement . finally , receiving credit through a credit card dispute , our " w " experience is behind us . read and believe , then book at the drake or . . . . chicago has many wonderful hotel options , but the " w " is definitely not one ! 
we use this hotel for business trips that require little hotel time and just a place to sleep . not only with the la quinta membership are the rooms always clean , modern and with a good desk , we also get good rates . the breakfast is basic but will keep you going until lunch . no social area for business meetings but the clean , cheap room makes it a useful choice for the business traveller . 
my girlfriend and i stayed three nights in a swissotel executive room during a recent chicago vacation . we have mostly very positive things to say , and would probably stay there again if we ever go to chicago . at least if we can find as good a deal as we did this time . i would like to point out some things you should be aware of N ) there ' s a lot of construction work around the swissotel . the hotel seems to be N soundproof , so that ' s no problems . but within a year or so the magnificent lake view will probably be only a memory of the past . the same goes for the view of the park area to the south . N ) make sure that you don ' t get a room right next to the elevators , since these make a lot of sound , speedy as they are . we first got room N , but had to change . no problems at all at the front desk - they seemed to be used to it . the original room had a lakefront view which was stunning . the second room overlooked the city and river , with a good look of the wrigley building . not as exciting , but still very good . beware of office workers who probably can see right into your room from a N feet distance . N ) we had an executive room which granted us access to the Nnd floor executive lounge with day-round complimentary beverage service ( non-alcoholic ) , an evening serving of hors d ' ouvres ( sorry for the spelling ) and pastries , and free internet access . also a great view . the executive status did not grant us free access to the gym , which came for a cost of N . the pool and sauna was free for all guests . N ) the restaurant and bar service on the ground floor was ok , but during our stay , the lobby was always really full of other guests . maybe since the hotel had a really good spring offer , which attracted more private guests compared to the usual business people . N ) the executive room was smaller than expected , probably a standard room , although on high floors . i would probably choose a corner room next time , which looks larger on their website . the king bed was excellent , lcd-tv really nice , and the room came with a stereo with ipod docking station as well as a really good coffee brewer . nice ! the bathroom featured both a tub and a shower and was in perfect condition . the last remark in fact goes for the whole room , the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated . N ) make sure to sign up for the club swiss gold bonus program before your stay for better front desk service and it will strengthen your chances of a free upgrade . all in all , swissotel chicago was a great experience , which i definitely would recommend . 
i stayed here for two nights with my girlfriend over the july Nth weekend . the hotel exceeded my expectations and i would definitely stay there again . pros -the rooms were well appointed and very comfortable ( the beds are extremely comfortable ) . -service was excellent from valet to front desk -sundeck had a great view and amenities looked nice although we didn ' t use them -compared to other hotels the prices for extras such as the mini bar and parking seemed reasonable cons -i didn ' t like the sliding door in the washroom , not as private as i would have liked -restaurant was overpriced for the quality of food and service ( don ' t bother with breakfast ) 
do not stay here ! ! ! our room was unsanitary and the front desk staff did not care - even the woman who identified herself as the front desk manager . this is not worth it to you no matter what the cost . 
stayed at hampton inn majestic N nights first weekend of may , N . traveling with wife and N year old son . great location . within walking distance of anything within loop . blue line and red line stops only one block away . easy to get a taxi or catch a bus . queen beds were very comfortable , rooms very clean , not huge , but adequate . employees were very friendly , always greeting with a smile and willing to chit chat . breakfast was average for this class of hotel - cereals , make your own waffle , yogurt , fruit , juices , coffee , muffins , rolls . everything was fresh . rooms were pretty quiet considering downtown location , but could hear sirens , etc . would stay here again . 
i love the conrad , the rooms are larger than most hotels in the area , the bathrooms have separate shower and tub , with plenty of granite counter top space ! we love the hotel restaurant for breakfast and the bar for a night cap . the staff is also great , so accomodating , we wanted theater tickets for the same night we arrived and had them within N minutes from the concierge . not least of all the hotel is so convenient with michigan av on one side , rush on the other , and nordstrom ' s right there . we will definitely stay there again . 
we had an issue with making a phone reservation and not receving an email confirmation . when i decided to call to confirm our reservation the afternoon of the night we were scheduled to arrive , i was told there was no reservation under my name . come to find out , an error had somehow been made and we were booked at a different hilton . we were able to come to a compromise , however . this hotel is very conveniently located downtown within walking distance of many shops , restaurants . . . . hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating . pool hottub were decent , although quite small . this was a family vacation for us and we were overall impressed with the hotel . tip park your own car for much cheaper . . . . just park near an elevator in the parking ramp . . . . it ' s the same place for valet parking ! ! 
we felt safe and comfortable . the staff was completely helpful being it was our first time in the windy city . the rooms were super clean and homey . the vallet service was also wonderful and speedy , however a little pricey for this small town girl . the location was perfect ! ! we walked to the navy pier , sears tower and there are stores and fine dining all around it . museums are only a N dollar cab ride away . i loved chicago and this hotel only made our stay better ! ! ! 
my husband and i visited chicago many times , but this time decided to bring our little dog along for a weekend get away in chicago . this hotel is conveniently located downtown near the chicago river . it is a very nice hotel , something you would choose even if you don ' t travel with your dog . only the Nnd floor allows dogs , which is too bad for dog owners , as there is no real high rise view . the hotel personnel is friendly to dogs and welcomed our dog . they also offer dog sitting if you choose to dine without your pooch . you can leave your dog in the room if you leave him crated . this hotel offers complimentary happy hour ( munchies and drinks ) and also complimentary breakfast on every floor . we had a very nice stay at this hotel and our pooch really , really enjoyed her stay . every sunday there is a " canine " cruise which was very interesting to take . an hour and a half of cruising down the chicago river and out on lake michigan . it is the same as the regular architectural cruise , except pooches are allowed . very nice ! we all had a good time . 
this hotel has some issues at the front desk . to have one person handling checkouts at prime checkout time and no backup is very regrettable . single file , one at a time , please . no , it is inexcusable . at check out today there was no one at the supervisory level available , only one desk clerk who was not up to the job . allegedly the others were " in a meeting . " the entrance to the hotel is poorly managed by the doorman with the result that guests are allowed to temporarily park hapazardly in the only entrance exit for taxis and other transport . a good property manages their front door to the house better than this one . the amount of open space in front of the hotel is very limited , which makes managing the abandonment ( even temporary ) of vehicles in that space especially critical . the signage to get from ground level to checkin is miserable . one has no idea whether to go to floor N or floor N without spending time trying to figure it out because the brass plates on the elevator do not instantly identify which floor a new guest goes to . hint checkin is on N . the restaurant is on N , but the guest services director at the desk right in front of checkin on N does not have the menu for the day . " you ' ll have to up a floor , sir , and ask the hostess for the menu . " so , just to find out what the restaurant serves one waits for an elevator , goes up an entire floor and wastes time . inexcusable bad service and poor property management because it can be fixed so easily with minor attention to detail . the area in the suite bathroom dedicated to the basin , mirror , etc is extraordinarly small , narrow and cramped . there are inadequate power outlets here . a mouse would feel hump-shouldered . there is a signficant deficiency of electrical outlets all over the entire guest room except at the writing desk , which has one extra outlet mounted on the edge . the room lamps appeared tohave three-way bulbs and many of the settings are burned out , making a guest think the entire lamp doesn ' t work until trying different combinations of the main switch at the entrance and repeatedly pushing the switch on the lamp to find the setting that is not burned out . inefficient , maddening and poor maintenance . room service menu is N hour but heavily weighted to breakfast and sandwiches . room service prices are , of course , extremely expensive . the food quality was above-average and delivered in a reasonable time period . room rates are steep for the quality delivered in the room . an inexperienced traveler may think it ' s a quality location and hotel , but there are much better properties available to the experienced business traveler and they deliver better value . the location is first-rate , however . 
we took advantage of the chicago bears package and saved hundreds of dollars . it included free valet parking , bears game tickets with excellent seats , and the room for the night . the room was extremely clean and extremely quiet . the beds were a little soft and i do think they were doubles . the room is small and the bathroom is very small , but for just a night or two , it was just fine . sometimes we had to wait a bit for the elevators . the pool is on the Nth floor and has a great outdoor deck with nice chairs and tables for relaxing . there is even a lifeguard for the pool . we ate chicago style pizza at lou malnatti ' s which was just N blocks away . get there early--it was crowded with bears fans before gametime . we had great weather and were able to walk the mile to soldier ' s field for the game . the next day we checked out but stowed our bags with the bellman and took the double decker bus tour for N a person . the bellman can give you the information . he was very helpful . the bus took us all over the place and you could get on and off all day and see the many sights . i highly recommend the double decker bus tour . my family and i hope to do the essex hotel bears package again sometime . it was very worthwhile ! 
got a last minute rate of N a night through hotels . com . requested a room with two double beds and wasn ' t disappointed . staff was very professional . food at aria was delicious . located right off of michigan avenue with prime shopping less than a block away . cabs always available in front of hotel for longer excursions . to park , enter off of columbus drive and let valet take care of it for you . all in all , an excellent choice . 
the hyatt is located on the river downtown within walking distance of the magnificent mile , many restaurants , millennium park , and navy pier . i had an Nth floor room with river view and it was much more spacious and comfortable than the allerton hotel downtown . there are two towers , which got a bit confusing trying to navigate underground to get to an adjoining office building . but there is a cozy irish pub ( o ' daddy ' s ) and the very trendy ( and pricey ) big bar , known for fancy cocktails . there is also a steakhouse that looked pretty upscale , and i didn ' t try it since i was alone . for breakfast , the lobby cafe is fast and convenient for coffee , bagels , etc . be prepared to pay for internet anywhere in the hotel . i avoided this by going pretty much anywhere else , like coffee shops , bars nearby that have free wifi . the downside i got back home and looked at the bill in more detail . i was not prepared for what the single rate was , with no extras at all . my company and i researched it to make sure i was not overcharged . what i was charged per night was nearly twice what was listed on the internet for the same room . apparently for these particular weeknights in late september , all hotels in that area were charging that much , and this was even the cheapest . there are always conferences going on in chicago , but i still don ' t know why these nights were so hot . maybe something to do with the olympics ? the upside the helpful staff . i realized on the flight home i left my cell phone in my room . i called when i got home and security found it and assured me it was in a safe . customer service took my information and made arrangements with fedex for me to have it shipped home . i opted for overnight delivery and received it right on time , intact . i was sure it was going to be broken . i was really in a panic about it getting stolen , so it was reassuring to know they were taking care of it . they are also on the go airport shuttle ' s route if you are flying in out of o ' hare . 
excellent hotel in every possible way . food was excellent and the staff was most accommodating and professional . 
my only other experience of a conrad was at the one in dublin about N years ago or so . the chicago facility was a pleasant reminder of just what a fine product the conrad brand is . location was excellent , decor subdued and tasteful , service friendly and ( generally ) helpful . my only complaint was that the staff did not seem terribly responsive to my noting that the lock on the door of my room seemed defective . someone was apparently sent to look at it , but i never received any feedback explaining the problem or why it was not fixed . 
liked this hotel as it is close to my office , and not so close to the mag mile tourist traffic area . the staff in the hotel is very friendly - when i checked in they were going thru an upgrade on their system , and doing things the manual way took a bit longer than normal , but not too bad . upon entering the hotel there was a man that " appeared vagrant " sleeping on the couch in the lobby - he didnt bother me per se , but he was bothersome looking . . . the room itself was nice - this is an older hotel and the tv , carpet , etc were actually quite fresh looking so that was a treat . the only other room issue was the bathroom - the tub had some black crust that washed away upon turning the water on so not sure where that came from . . . the shower did not work very well and there was a lot of water that came from the spout and shower , so you had to take a shower ankle bath at the same time , not enjoyable . but again , overall with these minor hiccups a moderately priced hotel and pretty decent deal for me . 
helpful and nice staff , great location ! ! would stay again , most definatelly ! 
the pros nice concierge desk , however not manned after hours . not too far from marathon departure area . the cons small rooms considering the price , paper thin walls ( baby crying next door can be heard ) , poor maintenance , low level of service from laundry ( late delivery , no efforts made to meet client requests ) , no international channels on tv
i read many of the one-star reviews and was wary about my stay at congress plaza , but i was pleasantly surprised . yes , it ' s an old building . yes , it could use some updating . yes , there were picketers at times ( though they simply went about their business of picketing ) . however , my room was very clean ( much cleaner than some places i ' ve stayed in chicago for twice the cost ) and the bed was quite comfortable . i enjoyed being in an historical building that hadn ' t been gutted and whitewashed to fit some generic standard . if you want a sparkly hotel with rooms that seem as though you are the first ever to stay in them , this isn ' t the place for you . if you like a bit of character , then i recommend it . i wish i had ponied up for a room with a view , because it looked like those would be lovely . the location is perfect and easy to get to by l train blue line from the airport . my only real complaint was that all of the reports of no truly hot water were confirmed when i took a shower . the hotel does need to update its plumbing system . 
we love this hotel . we visit the chicago area often and this hotel has it all . it is clean and the beds are great . i love the location , everything is within walking distance . i wish i had known about it sooner . we stayed at the omni hotel two years ago and we were very disappointed . the omni has a great location if you are just visiting the american girl place however the american girl is now moving locations . my recommendation is to stay at the raffaello were you are centrally located to everything ! -caroline , ohio
stayed for seven nights . the hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly and extremely helpful . the location is great . one block to the mag mile and about N blocks to the red line subway station . the only problems we had were that our room was not ready when we arrived and we were told it would be about an hour and they would call us on the cell phone when ready . we stopped back an hour and a half later and the room still was not ready . about an hour after that we still had not received a call . stopped back again and the room was still not ready . they were however able to get us into another room at that time . the other problem is that the hotel does not really have a restaurant and they do not have a cocktail lounge . the breakfast buffet room on the Nth floor is lame and overpriced . we ate there the first morning and never went back . overall a pleasant sheraton experience . philip the doorman is the best ! 
we just got back from a N night stay at this hotel and i thought it was great ! the decor is very modern , the rooms were clean with comfy beds and large walk-in showers and the staff was friendly . they had free internet in-room and we used the business center to print boarding passes before we left . the location was just a few blocks from michigan avenue , with great bus routes closeby , plus there are some good restaurants right around the block . no , the rooms aren ' t huge but our queen room had plenty of space for us . 
i stayed at the chicago monaco on halloween night N . the location is great . easy walking to shops restaurants not far from the bus stop . as usual the monacos are beautifully decorated . we enjoed excellent service an evening wine reception . the restaurant south water kitchen had served a wonderful breakfast a delightful staff . they are a pet friendly hotel as well . they offer a business center which allows free access to the internet . the rooms are a little larger than normal . i would return with out hesitation . ka snodgrass aaa travel
i spent one evening at this hotel on a business trip . the suite rooms are very spacious and the set up was good . pros convenient location to o ' hare and all state arena convenient access to trains to o ' hare and downtown chicago large glass shower business area was easy to use decent restaurants and bar areas starbucks on site cons no bathtub ( didn ' t bother me ) very hot exercise area utilitarian pool area fine for business travelers seeking exercises , wouldn ' t recommend for families good value . 
clean rooms , reasonable price , reasonably quiet - providing you get a room that doesn ' t face onto the main highway behind the building . liked the pool on the roof . its a little way out of the center , but handy for the sears tower . well served by cta metro ( N . N from airport direct to hotel ! ) and by chicago free trolleys . not much choice of resturants nearby , but hotel cafe ok for breakfast . 
enjoyed three nights at dana from august N - N . the hotel is very modern , perfectly located , clean and well priced . we managed to get it at N cdn per night . problems we encountered the room was very small and dark . we were on the backside of the hotel and the window was only a patio door . made the room depressing , but we did not spend much time in the room during the day . room was also not well positioned . the tv was facing the side of the bed , rather than at the foot . as there was no sitting area , watching tv was difficult . finally , the dana advertised that a continental breakfast was included in the price . they cancelled the breakfast starting august Nrd but failed to tell anyone . very misleading . the good part the staff is very friendly . the concierge ( aleksandra ) was extremely helpful and spot on with her restaurant recommendations . she even tried to make up for the cancelled breakfast by offering a complimentary bottle of wine from the room . by the way , the bar fridge selection in the room is good and well priced . excellent ipod speakers in the room . at this price , i would stay again , but get a room in the front of the building . 
stayed there for a week and was extremely impressed by the staff , who made this probably our best hotel stay ever . by our second day there , the doormen greeted us by name as we came and went and remembered little details about where we said we were going . the concierge was very friendly and super helpful , arranging nice tours and getting us awesome seats for a musical . the room was small , but the floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel much bigger than it was . we enjoyed the chocolate covered strawberries that were waiting for us when we got to the room . the separate tub ( it was huge ) and shower were nice , too . the restaurant had good food at suprisingly reasonable prices . the hotel location was fairly good we were able to walk to some places , but mostly took cabs . overall , though , it ' s the staff that made sutton place top notch . 
yesterday there was a huge power outage in the chicago area . all hotels were booked solid . since we are platinum premier members , i called marriott to locate a room . this was the only place available , other than downtown or gurnee ( we live on the northshore near winnetka wilmette ) . anyway , checked in with edward and received an " upgraded " room which was larger ( and we have N small kids ) . the room was super far on the other side of the hotel , and it was horrible ! it wrecked of a staleness . the carpets were filthy as my sons allergies began to startup . just awful ! i called and requested a room change . they gave us the same tired room on a different floor . i requested a " reinvented remodeled room " and the indicated that they were out . the rooms were going for N per night , but we could use points since my husband travels alot . he has been loyal to marriott for years ! when i told the manager amber ( i believe this is her name ) , she could not provide a new room . . . . so we left ! ! i told her that my family cannot sleep in that awful room and to return our points ! we operate on principal , for N , this place is substandard and nothing even close to marriott standards . and to use reward points doesn ' t matter ---my husband earned those points through travel and being away from our family , we don ' t use these arbitrarily ! for the cost of the room , one can stay in rhe same type room at the ritz or the four seasons ( for perspective ) . anyway , the hotel is very dated . reviewed the room service menu and it ' s limited and does not have a kids menu -- you have to tell room service and they will provide the options for kids . parking is N for overnight guests -- this is chicago ! i imagine that if you have a redone room and were with marriott rewards , and were flying into chicago and had business to attend to across the street , then this hotel may work . if not , look elsewhere as i cannot recommend it at all ! we did not stay here . after the episode with the manager , we checked out and decided to wing it at home . we lit candles in the dark and had cold showers this morning --- and it was still better than staying in that outdated facility that they are calling a marriott property ! ugh ! 
we stayed at the union league club for a wedding and found the accommodations to be adequate . the room was a little small but nice . the rest of the hotel could use a little updating , although the ballroom for the wedding reception was the nicest i ' ve ever been to and the reception was superb from start to finish . the bar restaurant on the Nth floor had good food and was a good value . i didn ' t care for the service charge that was tacked on to the nightly rate and parking was very expensive , although that is probably standard for this area of the city . the hotel is in a great location . there is a strict dress code and i wish that the reservations clerk had mentioned it so that we could have been prepared for brunch the next day . 
the swissotel has everything going for it and should be ranked higher . location perfect . it s right by the chicago river and it s proximity to lake shore drive , makes for a quicker cab ride to the airport or north to wrigley field . there are few buildings between the swissotel and lake michigan , making for gorgeous views , yet you are in the heart of it all . the michigan avenue bridge is only two blocks away . grant park and navy pier are also a short walk . rooms if you can swing it , get a corner suite . because the building is a triangular shape , you get a sweeping view that is absolutely stunning . a lot of windows , but nice light-tight drapes for a good nite sleep . tasteful modern decor and roomy . the bathroom and bedroom are separated by a good distance . the beds are heavenly . views from a corner suite , you can see the navy pier , millenium fountain s hourly water arch across the chicago river , lake michigan the harbor , buckingham fountain and part of millenium park . we were lucky enough to see the N Npm fireworks show from our window that are set from navy pier on the weekend . staff has that midwestern charm . the bell hops and front desk personnel are very helpful and friendly . i did not hear a peep out of housekeeping who were respectful . misc . every third floor has an ice machine . the Nth and Nth floors for example have ice . the location of the machine is in an isolated room , i m assuming to drown out the noise . it was a little creepy at night . guys won t care , women may feel a little ill at ease , but could certainly call room service . the staff is quite accommodating . in the lobby the hotel offers complimentary water , which may not sound like much , but the ice cold jugs have freshly cut fruit in them such as melon or strawberries . the restaurant in the hotel is the palm which has several locations nationwide and serves up a good steak . if you take a river architecture cruise , the guides will point out the swissotel as one of architect harry weese s triangle obsessed marvels . i was very impressed with this hotel and its staff . i m looking forward to more visits in the future and i highly recommend the swissotel to anyone traveling to chicago . 
this hotel is set in the perfect location and they must have spent months hiring all the staff . they are all so friendly and polite . the food at state and lake is amazing ! bacon burger . . . . mmmmmmmmmmmm ! from arriving with rudy in valet , then matt the best bellman i have ever seen in my N years of constant travel and hotel stays to annie at the desk that checked me in with a smile and a warm cookie ! everyone else i ran into was so approachable and friendly . but anything we had a question about or needed help with we went back to matt . he was so knowledgeable about chicago ( and the world for that matter ) and made us feel like more than just guests of a hotel . i believe we made a true friend . checkout was a breeze with onni . and we will definately make thewit a permenant chicago based home whenever we visit . rooms are very clean and so modern . everything was perfect ! 
i have stayed at the hilton right next store . these hotels are similar . parking is expensive , however . it costs N . N a day for valet parking and N if you park your own car--N . N more if you have an suv . hotel service is friendly- room is very clean . modern bathroom . 
we got really lucky on priceline and got the chicago hilton . truly a historic marvel . we were in awe when we walked in since we weren ' t expecting much . you should get a tour . we were lucky - the manager greeted us in the morning and kindly offered a personal tour . the swimming pool is very nice ( free ) and so is the gym ( N day ) . our room was just ok . the beds were small - we asked for N doubles . it caters to conventions so i think the double beds might be undersized to accommodate those who want to share rooms . also , the room was quite warm and we couldn ' t get it to cool . but this place is an experience and right across from grant park . memorable time ! 
we recently stayed at the hotel for one night in order to park and fly out of o ' hare . the hotel far exceeded our expectations . the room was nice and clean . the shuttle was waiting right outside the door and we were able to leave our car for N days . the price could not be beat . i recommend this hotel the next time you are flying out of o ' hare . 
from the moment that we arrived ( at N a . m . and after a long cold evening of travel ) , we were greeted and treated like royalty from the desk manager , milton , and staff . we three couples booked the " adventure " on travelzoo and were not sure what to expect from a hotel that was under renovation . let me tell you that the rooms , comfort of the beds , decor , snacks , attention to detail in directions , suggestions for resturants , shopping and area attractions , anything and everything that we asked of the staff , was all first class ! the preformance of ' wicked ' and devon ' s seafood resturant were supreme ! i was amazed how the staff remembered our names and welcomed us back after each outing . we can hardly wait to return to the ' family ' at the affinia ! milton made our visit extremely memorable ! thank you ! 
we stayed at the affinia because of a N deal which had to be prepaid with no cancellation refunds . the junior suite was very spacious although the furniture was a bit of a jumble . waits for elevators . had to pay for everything extra - high rates for internet , N water , N usa today , spa fees ridiculous . coffee provided in lobby until N only on weekdays . the location was great for sightseeing , but there aren ' t many restaurant options within walking distance - gino ' s east next door if you like deep dish pizza ( we don ' t ) and marcus samuelsson ' s c-chop in the hotel itself didn ' t seem like a very happening place - i ' d find a place closer to the river next time . i do have to commend them , though , for refunding a night ' s lodging when we had to come in a day late due to hurricane irene , although the people at the desk questioned it a bit on checkout ( i had called the day before we were to check in after rebooking my canceled flight hoping for an upgrade and was told we ' d be refunded despite the non refundable booking ) . also , it ' s a pet friendly hotel - nice to see dogs in the elevator . 
to begin with i made the mistake of booking through an internet booking site , thus paying N more than most of the guests for the same or lesser rooms . my fault , not the hotel ' s , but it doesn ' t help . while the website advises that the hotel is " close to union station " it is in fact a full mile away . check-in was awful we arrived around noon and were allowed to store our bags until the Npm check-in time , about which they were very strict by Npm , the lobby was filled with over N people who had arrived at various times during the afternoon but were not permitted to check in until exactly Npm . the rooms have no irons or ironing boards no mini bar no microwave things you ' d get standard even at a much cheaper roadside location . each room had a radiator and an air conditioning unit build into the window such that the window could not be opened this became a problem during the night when the power in the room failed in the stifling heat . the desk clerk responded to my complaint that the circuits were overloaded and nothing could be done . that ' s probably true the overhead light switch in the room sparked when i switched it ! at one point during the day at least one of the elevators got stuck and a guest had to climb out . the free " high-speed " internet is so slow that a short video would take close to an hour to download . the shelf over the sink in our bathroom was broken , leaving absolutely no place to store toothbrushes , etc . water pressure in the shower was poor ( although we were on a high floor in this N-storey building ) . we expected a complimentary continental breakfast , as their website advertised this , but when we got there , they told us they ' d stopped doing that - although that ' s one of the features i ' d paid for . the location is excellent - a block from the cta red line and a block or so from buckingham fountain - in a very noisy but busy and safe area of the city . despite the check-in fiasco and their inability to fix the power outages , the staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful . the " fully equipped " business center consisted of one computer and a non-functioning printer . this place was so much cheaper than anything else in the city , i should have realized it was too good to be true . i ' d recommend it , because for the difference in price i ' d volunteer to suffer . it ' s a glorified hostel , and if you can deal with that , this place is ok . 
we stayed here for four nights after getting a good deal on lastminute . com and honestly could not fault it in anyway , the staff were pleasent and courteous ( the concierge in particular was helpful in booking us a river cruise ) , with check in swift and hassle free , we had a spacious partial river view room with an extremely comfortable bed and an excellent power shower , we were room only so cannot comment on the hotel food but einstiens bagels is only a block away and was very reasonable for breakfast . in terms of location we got a blue line train from terminal N at o ' hare straight into park and lake ( about Nmins ) and the hotel was only a Nminute walk away , about N minutes walks you to the mag mile one way and to the shops of north state street the other ( filenes , old navy , macys etc ) . the house of blues was just across the road which is a must see and there are plenty of bars and restaurants in close proximity
this hotel was absolutely perfect ! i traveled with two of my good friends and we got a great rate for a fairly large room ! we had a king sized bed and a sofabed and two large tvs a stereo . it was clean , and the staff was friendly and helpful . after we checked in , they called to make sure the room was okay ! the location was also perfect not even N minutes from michigan avenue and within easy walking distance of navy pier ! the room ended up being N split N way ! i would recommend this to anyone staying in chicago . 
we stayed here for N nights recently and had a fantastic trip . the hotel ' s location is the biggest plus--so close to so many amazing restaurants and lots of great shopping . the free breakfast and supper were a huge hit with our N kids , although it was quite busy , especially at breakfast time . however , there was always lots of food being replenished . the pool was a big hit with our kids , and they didn ' t complain at all about the temperature . staff was helpful and friendly , the rooms were very clean and spacious . the kitchenette with full fridge , microwave , dishwasher etc . was great ! parking is expensive , but so are all the chicago hotels downtown . we will definitely go back here . 
the lobby was really clean and looked very much more high quality than i expected for the price . upon arriving at our room it appeared to be clean and included a refrigerator . there was a small sitting area with two small couches and double beds , which was perfect since we were not really close to public transportation . typically i like to stay closer to the trains , but parking was free and there is not much going on in this neighborhood so i probably won ' t recommend walking last at night alone for the average tourist . 
the room ( king loft ) , the library , the coffee bar , the books , the games , the public express room service , the pump room , the pump room photos , the bicycles , the neighborhood and most of all the friendly , helpful and happy staff ! all earned our love from hello . will return again and again . 
first time visit to the ritz carlton chicago , travel with wife and N kids . we had N deluxe adjoing rooms , very confortable beds ( four seasons bed ) , good size rooms , ample bathroom with premium amenities . service at the highest standard - four seasons - always with a smile and ready to help . the lobby area has a beautiful water fountain that provides serenity and peace while having breakfast nearby or enjoying a drink in the bar , also next to the fountain . the hotel is on top of a mall with N stores , with a few restaurants and deli ' s in the base floor . everything is close to the hotel , restaurants , bestbuy , american girl store . its like being in Nth ave n . y . , without the noise and hasle of n . y . , very quiet city with nice and respectful people . we enjoyed the ritz carlton and would recommend to friends and family . 
i stayed at the affinia during the weekend of january Nth and january Nth . this was a very wonderful hotel . the front desk staff was wonderful and always curtious and polite . just about everytime i either left the hotel or came into the hotel the front desk called me by name and even remembered where i was coming from ! ! this may be a bit different then the experience others had , but i stayed in the penthouse suite . it was quite nice and had everything one would need for a great stay . as you can see from the pictures i had a private balcony , livingroom , very large bathroom with both soaking tub and N person shower and a nice sized bedroom with king sized bed . the views were breathtaking and i purposly left all the blinds open at night so i could sleep under the city lights . now , don ' t get me wrong , some of the furnishings were a bit outdated and not brand new , but i really didn ' t care much about that . the service and location make up for that easily ! and that brings me to my next point about this hotel . the location ! you are one block off of michigan ave right next to nordstrom . it is a short walk to water tower place and the chicago river . this hotel was everything i expected and more ! if you are thinking whether or not to stay at this hotel i would highly advise you trying it out . let me point out one thing though . this isn ' t a super fancy dancy hotel , but you aren ' t paying through the nose for a room either . if you are going downtown and want to stay off the strip for a reasonable price , this hotel is for you ! the service will be great and the room will suit your needs fine . 
i read mostly good reviews about this place and i agree . i know , the rooms are small . so what ? i guess they should advertise this on their website or something . because of you take the room size out of the equation , everything else is above expectations . i mean even the room size is not a big deal , granted we don ' t have any kids and did not have a lot of luggage . but i mean if you go there and you know you most likely are going to have a smaller room then it ' s not such a big deal . from the moment you walk into the hotel you feel the difference , the smell , feel and look of everything is really well thought out . check in was nice and quick . our room was wonderful , it ' s nicely decorated , i loved the new bed and linen , i loved the desk and tv . there was something special about that room . the bathroom was again on the small side of things but still very nice . i liked it . they don ' t have coffee in the room but they have complimentary coffee in the lobby all morning long . if you ' re reading this review you know the hotel is in a good location . there is a parking right across the street on clark street that is N dollars for N hours . not bad for chicago . i got this hotel on priceline but i will not hesitate to book it again without priceline in the future . i am looking forward to trying their spa with my wife . go to the hotel felix , you won ' t regret it . 
i love the suite because you get the additional room . tvs in both the living room and bedroom , not that we used them so much , but nice to have . the complimentary buffet makes the morning so easy . the food was good and there was a good variety . the doorman and concierge were great help ! 
this hotel has an excellent location on chicago ' s golden mile and is within reach of all the major sites , especially the main shopping area . i stayed in the historic tower on one of the upper floors in february N . the water pressure is not great so high up , and it took about Nmin to fill the bath-if you like baths ! otherwise the room was comfortable and very clean . however , it was obviously partitioned off from a larger area with the usual problems of sound insulation from the room next door . the room was clean and reasonably well decorated , but in a rather N-Ns style with heavy drapes and large furniture needed e . g . to contain a large screen old style crt tv . the hotel has a really serious swimming pool ( at least N yds long ) which is kept well and appears to be in the original Ns ( ? ) decor-it is really a great place . the pool is free to guests , although the fitness room if used costs extra . the standard of service in the hotel was excellent , staff were always polite and seemed to observe the rule that the guest was always right . i had a cheap deal on this hotel as a result of a large conference block booking-around N dollars a night and for this it was a good deal . i guess such rates would only apply to such large block bookings , but if you can get a good deal , i would recommend staying here-especially if you like swimming ! . if not , and you are looking for more style , more modern decor etc you should consider other nearby places-the sheraton looked swankier-but probably much more expensive ? 
the beds are soo comfortable . travel quite often and i count these beds as one of only two hotels i have stayed in that have had beds this comfy . couldn ' t beat the view either . looking right at the hancock building out our window . didn ' t interact with staff much but the little we did was helpful . they even provided bandaids for my poor feet after buying new sandals ) very clean , very quiet . have recommended this hotel to family members already . only downside was that the breakfast options were a bit pricey for us , but plenty of options just a stroll down the street . 
unfortunately this trip was to attend a funeral , so it wasn ' t the best of circumstances . but thanks to the reviews on this site , we picked the holiday inn-midway airport . what a nice hotel ! new , very clean , and the service was outstanding . we called for extra hangars and pillows and they were delivered to our room within N minutes . and then the front desk phoned to make sure we had received what we requested . we were very impressed . the beds were very comfortable and the rooms were large . nice big flat screen tv with free hbo and a lot of other channels . small heated swimming pool and nice exercise room . our only criticism was of the in-hotel restaurant . the food was pretty awful there . but after our first experience , we found other restaurants very close by , so it was not really inconvenient . overall , a very pleasant stay . 
wow . . . a hard one to review . bbb rating was good . reviews were iffy due to some complaints . however , i decided to book anyway due to higher rates at other hotels during a sold out time period . i received a wholesale rate through resorts plus international even though the area was busy . the only complaint i have is the rooms were a little out dated . but the staff were friendly and accomodating . 
i stayed here the week of the insane heat wave that hit much of the us in july . i think it was N during the day , and in the Ns at night . my room was on the very top floor in the old tower , and the ac couldn ' t keep up . i had the thermostat set at N , and it was probably closer to N in the room . i mentioned this to the staff several times during my stay , and they temporarily fixed it twice , but i just gave up . the hallways to my room were oppressively hot . aside from the temperature issues , the hotel was great and i would definitely stay there again . the location is great , tons of bars and restaurants near by . 
i am a frequent traveler and hilton honors member . i normally stay at the hilton palmer house but wanted to be near northwestern so opted for the hilton suites . i was pleasantly surprised with my stay given reviews i had read prior to booking . the staff was very friendly . my suite was on an upper floor , very clean and i was happy with the size and layout . the bedroom , bathroom and living room area were all completely separate rooms with doors . i did not eat at the restaurant or go up to the pool so cannot comment regarding the other amenities . it was nice in the morning to have a small coffee shop available in the lobby area . i would stay here again and would recommend it to others , especially those with children for the price . 
i stayed for one night in october on the first leg of my multi city trip . as my plans had changed at almost the last minute i hadn ' t had a chance to notify the hotel that i was cutting my trip short . when i confirmed this at check in the desk clerk immediately asked if there was something they could do to change my mind . i explained that my trip plans had changed and he then offered me the choice of two rooms that were available , making a recommendation as to which he thought was best . this turned out to be a room in the west tower which is by far the quietest room choice . i made my way to my room and pretty much instantly ordered room service . this arrived within N mins and when i requested an additional condiment this was bought back up within N mins . the rooms are a good size with comfortable beds and pillows you literally sink into . the location is excellent for me as my office is within a ten minute walk . it s also within minutes of the magnificent mile for anyone looking to shop . my one disappointment was the fact there is an additional charge for wifi . 
i was surprised after all the horrible reviews to see that the hotel wasn ' t a complete hole . my brother booked the hotel , and i checked here to see how it rated . i was expecting to come into a rediculously bad room , but it was just more of a joke than anything . the bathroom is about the size of the closet , the bed was too close to the dresser , and you couldn ' t open it , and the stairs were closed . other than that , it wasn ' t too bad ! the rooms were fairly clean ( dusty , but tidy at least ) and the bed was comfortable . considering we were doing a lot of sight-seeing and were hardly at the hotel , it was perfect . 
hi friends i stayed for one night at the congress plaza hotel the weekend of may the Nst , i will explain why we only stayed one night later . after reading all of the reviews i was soooo scared of staying at the congress . i expected bugs , no a c , a dirty bathroom , dirty bed . . . i expected yuckiness to the Nth power . needless to say , i saw none of it . we had a lake view king on the Nth floor . the view was great ! the room and bathroom were clean . the park was across the street . the floors were clean . flat screen tv on the wall . the elevator doors look original . looks like where the rat pack might have stayed . it is not modern there is no hd tv it does not have floor to ceiling windows . it is not swanky or posh the only reson we stayed on night was because of the picketers . my bf just couldn ' t do it . crossing the picket line felt horrible . they have been picketing for N years . if you google it you will see why . so , if you want a clean room , clean bed , clean bathroom , a tv , a view of the lake and park and don ' t mind crossing the picket line . then stay here . but because of the picketers i just can not recommend it . 
this hotel is located minutes from the midway airport . it is staffed by very friendly and helpful people . it was so nice to be able to start the day well rested and full . the beds were comfortable and the rooms were quiet . the breakfast was very tasty and had many choices . 
this hotel is in a good location close to the lake and parks . also easy to get to the red and orange line . the rooms are comfortable but the cooling and heating system is not regulated by the guest . it is one unit and the hotel decides if ac should be on . i checked in at N Npm and the room was N degrees . it was like that most days out of my N day stay . at night with the window open ( and all the street noise coming in ) the room would get down to N maybe . 
we stayed at the palomar in chicago for two nights in early july and then returned for an additional night after some days in michigan . it is a very nice hotel with a decent swimming pool and is conveniently located . it was easy to come in from the airport on the subway , though unfortunately the station nearby was working on it ' s escalator , making coming up the stairs with heavy luggage a problem . the staff at the front desk is super helpful and recommended several good restaurants and sightseeing options . they booked our architectural boat tour , which was one of the best things we did in chicago . we would definitely stay there again . 
big fancy conference type hotel , maybe about N blocks from michigan ave -easily walkable to shopping . we stayed in the higher floors , the room was very clean and modern for the most part . no mini fridge but ice machine nearby . the room provided a bottle of water but i didn ' t touch it since i would imagine they they would charge you N for it ? didn ' t have time for swimming but the indoor lap pool looked decent although the water looked a little merky . . there is a pool towel boy check in desk before you enter so you would think he would have time to check the chemicals once in awhile . nice outdoor deck looking over the river . tip free internet at the internet cafe down in the basement area . a block across from the hotel is a domicks grocery , walgreens , amc theater game place , its about a N minute walk to the navy pier and millinium park . i would suggest taking a cab to millinium park-its walkable but had to go through a long under pass and it smelled like urine and it was creepy . 
this was my Nrd or Nth stay at the talbott . i really do love this hotel . the location is only N blocks from the chicago state red line stop . N blocks from michigan ave and the hancock tower . over the last N years since i started staying at the talbott when in chicago , i feel the value for the dollar isn ' t as good as it was . but this is understandable . it is a great hotel , so is on par with other hotels charging similar rates . you used to get passes to the fitness formula club ( gold coast location ) a short few blocks away , but now they give you passes to the equinox club which is actually closer on michigan ave . however , the fitness formula club was way better . it was much bigger and had a huge selection of equipment . so this is disappointing . free internet is very reliable . never once had any problem . next time i ' m in chicago , even though i love the talbott , i think i might try something else since the same money can buy other hotels rated just as high on trip advisor . 
second stay at a chicago hilton this summer . both rooms were dark with cost saver yellow lighting looked out at other rooms , not at the street or sky were huge but only partially furnished and were ice cold - even with air cond off . lobby ' s nice , room ' s not up to par with pleasant rooms at other hotels . these rooms will make you want to go home for sure . 
i really enjoyed staying at this hotel . it offered everything i was looking for and made my stay in chicago one of the best . thank you for the lovely accomodations ! 
the only issue we had with this hotel was the valet . it ' s a zoo getting the car . great room for a great price on hotwire . com . 
my finance i visited chicago over labor day weekend stayed at the hyatt regency . i have stayed there before it ' s a very trendy hotel . the location is great ( even though it ' s on the south side of the river ) , with the ability to walk to grant park , down michigan avenue , and to navy pier . positives location , price ( if booked on-line in advance ) , rooms are updated have a mini frig w a fully stocked bar , an air purifier , comfortable beds , and the restuarants bars w in the hotel . the big bar is great for happy hour , however , very , very , trendy after N Npm . there ' s a convenience store next to the hotel and during the winter when it ' s cold , snowy , etc . ( the underground walkways are very convenient to get around in a several block area ) . improvement no pool or spa . you have to walk to the gym pay N a day to use it . the hip-hop bar on the weekends in the lobby with a long line mostly mid-N year olds , makes the hotel lobby extremely loud ( i feel sorry for the front desk staff ) . i recommend it to business travelers weekend get aways . not good for kids . 
decided to cruise down to chi-town for a long weekend as a little road trip to get out of this crazy city . checked with my friends on tripadvisor and found the majestic mile hampton that looked pretty good and was priced pretty reasonably . . . so i booked it . upon arriving , w monroe street was under some crazy renovation . . . so watch the pot holes and exposed manhole covers . the valet guys are really confusing but kind of funny and nice . expect to pay N night for valet ( or parking anywhere in the city ) with in and out priveledges . there are homeless people sleeping in the parking garage so they make you take out your electronics and sign a waiver . . . i guess it ' s expected anywhere in any major metro city . we were in a nice N sports car and didn ' t have any problems so i wouldn ' t worry about it . reception is on the Nth floor - angel at the front desk is awesome . . . really nice ! checking is a breeze and we stayed on the Nth floor . not much of a view since we faced an office building but i didn ' t really care . room is neat with pumpkin orange walls with high ceilings ( N ft ? ) . we had N double beds with a N inch samsung flat screen tv . did the bed bug test and didn ' t see anything . the mattresses actually looked pretty new but were a little too soft for my liking . sheets were crisp and clean and unsoiled . bathrooms are clean with a granite counter top and nice hot and powerful shower . no complains on the room . . . nothing fancy but super clean , comfortable , and nice . fitness centre is ' meh ' . it ' s free N N . . . N treadmills , N eliptical , a cable station , and balance ball . they all have tvs built in so bring your headphones or use theirs with ' supplied ear covers ' that were out of stock when i was there . i think that ' s kind of nasty anyway . . . who wants to wear some sweaty old headphones ? dang . . . ice is available on every floor and drink vending machines are on every Nnd floor . free breakfast ! a lot of free breakfasts are i but this one is decent . there are waffles , potatoes , bacon , english muffins , toast , cheese danishes , apple danishes , fresh fruit , apples , bananas , oranges , raisin bran , cheerios , another bran cereal , blueberry muffins , decaf , robust , regular coffee , and herbal teas . also a juice dispencer with apple , orange , and a mango guava juice ( i think ) . a nice perk is that coffee , tea , and some fruit is available complimentary N N in the lobby . i made some good use of it ! there are also pre-bagged breakfasts at the front desk if you have to grab one to go . two computers located in the lobby for internet access but i didn ' t use them since there is free wifi . overall , i ' d totally recommend . clean , safe , convenient . . . can ' t ask for more . to put the cherry on the sundae , it ' s right downtown . you can walk to food , the skydeck , willis tower , and many of the other attractions . and if you like shopping , you can get to state street where shopping starts . there is a forever N right on the corner followed by a t-mobile , huge macy ' s , cartier , disney store , puma . . . . chicago is a great city that everyone should see . it ' s layed out nicely with fantastic architecture and such a great character to it . the stuffed deep dish pizza is a must . only caution is that in the downtown area on friday and saturday there are a lot of people asking for money at dawn and later . . . . but even so , i felt safe . 
my wife and i stayed at the palmer house for one night . we scored a great rate through hotwire . we checked in on a friday afternoon . i expected the hotel to be busy since it was a holiday weekend . in addition , college football was at soldier field . the line at registration was fairly long . but it moved quickly . our room was on the Nth floor . the floor was recently rennovated . overall , the room was nice . it had two beds and two bathrooms . nice linens . what i don ' t understand is why the bathroom fixtures were of holiday inn quality . the rest of the room was done at the palmer house level of quality . kind of weird . we contacted housekeeping to have the linens changed due to allergies . they were changed promptly . the hotel is still undergoing rennovation . overall , another nice stay at the palmer house . 
i would like to compliment the talbott hotel after my incredible stay . my room was beautiful , roomy and luxurious . the talbott staff was very friendly , especially office manager sarah yates , who answered every question and went out of her way to make my stay one of the best in chicago . this truly is a five star hotel with an excellent location . i will make this hotel , my hotel of choice in chicago and you should too . 
the great location is my favorite aspect of this hotel . just steps off michigan ave . , and very near the red line subway . staff was friendly , rooms are small , but the sheets and pillows are heavenly . bathroom is also nice . they even had books in the room for you to look at . would definitely stay again . 
my friend and i stayed here for lollapalooza and it was in such a great location close to many attractions . we were able to walk wherever we wanted and the parking garage was close as well as much cheaper than many others . our first night we were in a suite and wow ! but when we had to go back to our original room it was very nice as well . all staff was helpful and there were no issues even with our late check in . for the location the price was also affordable . our only complaint was the overly firm beds . all in all , we ' d definitely stay here again ! 
great location for sightseeing , shopping , nightlife , anything important for the windy city ! the staff is more than nice , happy to give advice , help with the luggage and birng additional cosmetics in a minute . well . . . i guess the best luck that we have ever had when bidding for the hotel . i would recommend it for both business and private trips . 
my daughter and i came for a very short weekend and i was hoping for a carefree one . although i made it clear i was a light sleeper and needed a quiet area of the hotel , we ended up in a corner that allowed me absolutely no sleep with all the ambulances blaring all night . no problem . . . they adjusted my bill and moved us to a different corner and higher floor for the second night . perfection ! room service dinner the first night was not a success and the room smelled from the fish most of the night . no problem . . . they adjusted the bill and the second night we ordered their ' design your own ' pizza . don ' t miss it ! without reservation i say it is the best i ' ve had anywhere ! if you require a firmer bed , do ask for the boards they are happy to place under the mattresses . finally , believe the concierge when he she says it would be prudent to order your shedd aquarium tickets online . i was absolutely astounded by the N N-mile long line when we got there . of course , with tickets in hand , we walked right in . finally , do sign up ( free ) for the select member program as this allows you free in-room internet access as well as a choice of beverages ( and a lovely cup of yogurt ) delivered to your room ( free ) in the morning . i can ' t wait to come back ! 
stayed recently for a conference and paid usN per nite . i had requested beforehand for , and was assured at reception upon check-in that my room was one of the newer , upgraded ones . but turned out to be an old room . as it was already past midnite , i didn ' t bother to complain . i shall not repeat the other reviewers ' comments about the smallness of the room and toilet , shocking lack of room fridge ( for a purportedly premier property ) ) and general tiredness of the property . if i do return to chicago , which is a great city , i really see no compelling reason to stay in the palmer again . 
my husband and i were in the palmer house hilton for five nights . i had read some reveiws previous to our stay . boy , were they off the money . don ' t fall for the negative reviews you see . the staff and concierges were wonderful . they were attentive to our needs and fulfilled them prefectly . the hotel was always very clean as well as our room . the beds were so comfy it was like being at home with our high count sheets and feather bed . the sound of the trains was faint so that was not an issue . the hotel was situated to alot of sights as well as resturants . we also walked to alot of places . if i ever go back to chicago i will definetly choose the famous palmer house hilton again . 
stayed at the hotel monaco for the very first time the weekend of november N . having never heard anything - good or bad - about the property , i had no idea what to expect . what a delight ! everything was excellent all the way around - from the decor , the impeccable maid service , friendly front desk staff ( thanks , mark ! ) , delicious food in the restaurant , great downtown location to the goldfish friend to keep us company ! as a suburbanite who often commutes into the city for events and a way to escape , i ' ve found a real gem that i ' ll visit again . be sure to sign up for their intouch loyalty program . this free membership gave us N towards a mini-bar purchase as well as free internet . 
just spent N nights at the hard rock on a wistle stop tour in chicago at the start of a tour around the usa . the best thing about the hotel is the location which is just over the river on michigan ave only a couple of hundreds yards form all the serious shopping on the magnificant mile . the rooms are of a good size for a city centre hotel and are pretty comfortable as long as you stay as high as you can due to road noise . the room service food was poor and quite expensive but if you avoid this your stay will be enjoyable . one thing me wife did not like was the fact that the rooms are poorly lit so it made getting ready ( make up etc ) a little tricky . things to make sure you experince in chicago include the shedd aquarium , the river tour and the cheesecake factory below hancock tower . 
stayed at the hyatt for business . took a cab to hotel . don ' t know if the subway will get you close to hotel . checked in went smooth even thought hotel was very busy . i had a room with a wonderful view of the river and the navy pier . room was clean and bed comfortable . this is a business hotel during the week , but can see how it would be a good tourist hotel also . i like the service and prompt attention . you can check out via phone , menu on tv or down at the the desk . there are limited places to eat around hotel but walk down wacker and there are lots of choices . ask at the front desk . there is an underground area with all kinds of places to eat . . starbucks , fast food , etc . connected to the west tower . enjoyed my stay and would return . 
i was very happy with the room and the N service they had . i think this is a great deal , if you ' re on the budget , and need mainly sleeping amenities . the parking is free , and the lot is fenced . we walked everywhere , to the hancock and the navy pier . kids had a blast for breakfast at the next door mcdonalds - which is the cleanest , and the best one i ' ve ever been to - with the museum and interactive stuff they have . the N hrs walgreens , two blocks down , was also very useful . this location is great , the kids were so excited to be in the middle of everything . in spite of the winter weather it was easy to have them walking around . there was an attraction on each block they walked on , like rainforest cafe , or the portillo ' s and barnelli ' s restaurant . the purpose for our chicago visit was to visit the downtown and the museums , and this hotel was awesome for our needs . 
found hotel on internet . looked up reviews and decided to book it . excellent choice . great location , easy to get around . comfortable room , especially bed . staff very helpful . conciege makes great suggestions re whats happening in the city . we took his advice and had a great time , both at a restaurant and show . will definately be back too chicago and will stay again at same millenium knickerbocker hotel . 
before arriving the room was booked on priceline at a very reasonable rate . the hotel was very centrally located downtown in a quiet neibourhood . hotel has free wi-fi for guests . the only downfall of this hotel is the size of the rooms . even for a single business traveler , i found the room to be very small . 
we stayed at the hotel for N nights , wish it could have been longer . to my surprise , i was upgraded to a N bedroom suite . . . the only thing missing was a view of lake michigan , but we managed ) my hilton honors membership allowed us access to the executive lounge , which had a stunning view of lake michigan . breakfast in the lounge offered thier famous ' muselli ' along with some wonderful pastries and baked goods , cereals , cheses , lox . . too much to mention ! the lounge is also open for cocktails ( for a fee ) and light appetizers . there seemed to be ample seating available and there was a computer there also . our room was more than spacious . when we opened the door to our room , we were in the foyer , roughly N feet long and N feet wide . on the right side was our living room with a wet bar . . . . there was no way this could be confused with a ' sitting area ' , this truly was a living room with full sofa and lounge chairs . the wet bar was a nice surpise and well used ! our bedroom contained an extrememly comfortable huge bed and another sofa . tv ' s in both rooms . the bathroom reflects the era when the hotel was built . . . walk in shower , soaking tub , mirrored sink , scale , the toilet seemed odd ( especially with the flush handle coming out of the wall ) but all worked well . i was thrilled to have such great housekeepers on our floor . they always took time to say hello and asked if we needed anything . they were getting the suite across the hall from us ready and offered a quick peak at the view of lake michigan . . . nice view , but our room had a seperate bedroom . . . . then . . . one of them said . . . . " go down to the end of the hall in about a half hour , we ' re getting another suite ready and winked . " turns out they were cleaning the " lady dianna " suite . . . . . . and . . . . . i got a sneak peak at that too ! ! ! ! there are so many surprises this hotel holds . the evelators have benches . . . never saw that before ! oh my gosh , our room had a doorbell ! we left something in our car and asked if we could get it out . . turned out it is a N minute walk to the garage . so , when you choose valet parking , please know your car is not being parked in the garage next to the hotel , but down the street . . . the valets were great and deserve any appreciation you can give them . the drake is one of those hotels that will remain in my thoughts as one i can not wait to go back too . yes , having a suite was lovely , but i would not mind having a standard room as well . thank you to all who made our short stay so memorable . 
stayed at the mk with my wife and teenage son for N nights august N -N , N and must say we experienced none of the problems mentioned in earlier negative reviews . we called ahead and requested a room with N beds which was ready even though we arrived at N pm . that was the start of some extremely courteous and efficient service we received from every member of the hotel staff . the room itself was a decent size -- we never felt crowded in it -- and was very clean and tastefully decorated . the beds were comfortable , climate controls worked well and water pressure in the shower was very good . the only negative was our bathroom was extremely small -- you felt cramped even with one person in it . otherwise we thought the rest of the hotel was in very good condition considering its age . the lobby area was nice and the martini bar and adjoining lounge area were very pleasant places to relax and enjoy a drink . plus the location is just great -- a short walk to the oak street beach , water tower place , rush street and dozens of bars , restaurants and shops . we paid N on priceline and thought that was a great value . we have been to chicago on several occasions but our stay at the millenium knickerbocker made this one an especially pleasant trip . we would definitely stay there again . 
my husband and i stayed N nights at the allerton and it has been a great experience , the staff has been very nice and helpful , they upgraded us to a suite , which was grand , the bed was absolutely very confortable . the location is just perfect , in the middle of magnificent mile , were all the shops are and very close to everything . i would definitely reccomend this hotel for a nice stay in chicago . 
just got back from chicago . stayed one night at the hotel N . the hotel is nice , but older . the room was big by chicago standards and it felt lacking in in decor . the views out of our Nth floor windows were fantastic . then there was the bed . i called it the fred flinstone bed . it was so hard and uncomfortable that i was unable to sleep all night . additionally , in the morning my back hurt . i mean really hurt . i thought the location was great , but i doubt i would ever stay here again . 
the allegro was great , very laid back and fun , but with enough quality amenities . my family went on a euro trip in the spring , and got a chance to stay in some pretty nice suites . my kids commented that they liked the allegro way better than any of the euro hotels which included the hilton waldorf london , swissotel istanbul , and westin excelsior rome . pretty cool . really beyond expectations based on how " depriciated " the property became in the final years of the hotel bismark era . the mattress furniture were in good shape , the attitude of staff was superb , and gift bags for kids and dog was a nice touch . i just wish i visited chicago more often . . . 
i have stayed at the james and will continue to stay there . room service is great . toiletries are the best . the vibe is similar to that of chicago , upbeat and unpretentious . trader joe ' s across the street for vino and extra water . i love having a nightcap in the bar or starting the night there . 
the comfort suites in chicago is a perfect location along the magnificint mile . it is close to shops and great restaurants . the room itself was great with a wonderful view of the river and some of the beautiful architecture that chicago is so famous for . one of my colleagues mentioned that she had a washer and dryer in her room . i actually thought she was joking until i opened up one of the doors in my bedroom and saw for myself that there truly was a washer and dryer . how convenient for travellers ! the staff was extremely helpful and i was especially impressed with the doormen . they always had a smile to greet you with and it was obvious they valued exceptional customer service . 
first off , my wife selected this hotel , not only because of its great historic nature , but , because they assured her that , i , who am disabled , would be amply accommodated during my stay , especially for my birthday . well , this did not happen ! our room was located extremely far from the elevators and was very difficult to orient in it was set up very poorly ! it was not at all " disabled friendly " ! for example , no curbside ramps , no commplimentory valet parking for the disabled , which incidentally i had to have valet parking was a whopping N . N a night ! additionally , no cable or satalite tv , no free internet access , no wet bar , no free coffee in the room , not even free continetal breakfast was offered . a mandatory N gratuity for room service is automatically added to room service charges . and this is only a few of the disappointments there are many others ! " pet friendly " wrong , there was a steath and outrageous N . N fee added to the room rate , if you possess a pet this was never mentioned until we checked-in ! we opted to spend good money ( N . N a night ) hoping to be catered to , but all we experienced , was a money sucking vacuum cleaner , with strong suction ! everywhere we turned , there was some sort of charge ! on a positive note , the hotel had comfortable beds . overall , i will never stay here again and i strongly do not recommend this hotel , especially , if you are disabled . chicago has myriads of fine hotels that do not fleece you opt to choose them ! highly disillusioned , robert f . 
 " luxury boutique , " " personalized service " and " spectacular setting " are not just words in the hotel ' s promotional materials , they are a " lifestyle " at the sutton place . they say it is impossible to make a second ' first impression ' and the staff at the front door , the concierge desk and the front desk are genius at accomplishing this . their warmth and hospitality made us feel like we were truly wanted the first time and every time we walked in and out the front door during our stay . david sowell , general manager , and jennifer pfeiffer , director of sales and marketing , were so gracious to meet . our stay was more than marvelous . thank you . 
stayed at swissotel the weekend of oct . Nth . the hotel is in a great location sort of in the middle between millennium park art institute and the shops on michigan avenue . we were able to walk everywhere and even to the train stop , which is maybe N blocks away . at night , it was too cold to walk , so we took cabs , even to places only N mile away . the hotel was simple , clean and didn ' t try to be too trendy or over the top , with mostly business travelers . the double room was spacious and clean . 
we stayed at this hotel for a conference . we were given an accessible room with a " roll-in shower " without a divider between shower floor -- we soon learned this meant a giant puddle in the middle of the bathroom floor that didn ' t dry the entire day . this room would be better used for someone with actual need for accessible accommodations . the room was small and dark , with a dismal view of an alley . but all this isn ' t unexpected for a city hotel what really rankled were the outrageous charges for every single amenity that by all rights should be included in a luxury hotel . internet access was N day ( ! ! is this N ? ) , the daily use of gym cost the same amount ( ! ! ! ) , and i was charged a N handling fee for a package i received at the hotel -- which wasn ' t even delivered to my room i had to actually walk over to shipping to pay for the privilege of being handed my package . it ' s truly disappointing that a landmark hotel should so gracelessly charge for basic amenities . the hotel showed signs of past splendor , but is now just a fancily wallpapered cash cow . staying at a modest holiday inn express , with free internet , gym and breakfast , would have been better . shame on you , hilton . 
despite mixed reviews on this site , my stay here has been wonderful . the staff is courteous and helpful . rooms are small but lovely . meeting rooms were great and internet was complimentary for our group . arrived mid- morning , asked for early check in and a room with a view and was graciously given both ! 
we stayed at this hotel last week for four nights and had a great time . the hotel was clean and the service was great . the reason i am writing this review is just to let others know the wifi was horrendous . the main lobby , the " link " in the lower lobby even in the club lounge on the Nrd floor . i was only able to get on once . the concierge said that it had been that way for months and that i could possibly get a reduced rate for service in my room which seemed like a bit of a scam in my opinion . also found the N pc in the lounge and however many in the links to be quite busy as there were a few conventions going on so while i did use them often had to wait . when wanting to check tour times and set our schedule for the day it did become a bit frustrating . on another note , while i did not attempt to use my cell phone i did hear from a few other guests that they found it difficult to get a signal . all in all this would not deter me from staying here again i just wanted to pass my feedback along . 
this is one of the " famous N hotels " in chicago ( others being the drake and palmer house ) . location is good , although a little far south along grant park if you are wanting to do mostly mag mile activities . but it is a short walk to many train connections . hotel is beautiful , lobby and ballrooms are legendary . i got a cheap ( N ) room on priceline on the start day of a major convention . they did give me a nice lake view framed with shedd adler to the right and burnham harbor in front of me . room was fine , bathroom spacious and quiet overall . only complaint was that a lamp base was broken on the vanity next to my bad , which should have been caught . room as clean enough , and as an honors member there is free bottled water ( not chilled though ) in the room . if you get a good price and plan activities in the loop south loop mag mile , or points west and south , this is a pretty good choice . food in kitty o ' shea ' s ( irish pub off the lobby ) was good and service friendly . pretty pricey , though no surprise there . chicago was great as always ! ! 
the intercontinental chicago is world class--at amazingly low rates ! from the beginning ( checking in with agnieszka szumal--who was polite , professional , personal ) to walking into a fabulous room ( with my wife son ) to enjoying the incredible pool gym ( not to mention the restaurant bars ) to shopping on the magnificent mile ( taking advantage of huge sales ) , our time at this hotel was simply fabulous ( we travel around the world , so we have a lot to compare it to ! ) . the next time you are in the windy city , do yourself a big favour . . . check into the intercontinental chicago ! 
my stay was very enjoyable . the hotel was centrally located . the staff and service provided was excellent . the complimentary full service breakfast was delicious . the cook prepared a delicious omelet . 
my N-year-old daughter and i enjoyed our N-night week-end stay at the conrad . the location is great - at the end of mag mile michigan avenue , connected to nordstrom ' s . the rooms are big for this area , and the bathrooms are nice and spacious . appreciated the separate door to the water closet . we took other readers ' advice and upgraded to the city-view room in hopes of reduced street noise ( these rooms do not face mich ave ) while i don ' t have a comparison , i am a light sleeper and slept very soundly . the fitness center was above average . if memory serves , there were N treadmills , N ellipticals , N stationary bikes , a few weight machines , and a full set of dumbells . i visited the fc at N N a . m . on a saturday and the only wait was for an elliptical . the complimentary aromatherapy pillows are a nice touch , and the eucalyptus offering helped with the travel-induced congestion . also appreciated by both my teenager and me was the complimentary wireless , to which we connected effortlessly . the hotel was at full capacity , but we did not have long waits for elevators as i have had at other area hotels . we did not try the restaurant or room ervice . had this been an adult-trip , the terrace looked like a perfect spot for a post-shopping cocktail . i have stayed at the marriott , wyndham , and embassy suites in the mag mile area , and i would say the conrad was the best of the N , based on its location the style , size and comfort of rooms and overall value . 
this sheraton was one of the best sheratons in which i have stayed . it had a few issues ( room not ready at check-in time , dresser door broken ) but everything was remedied quickly and with a pleasant smile . we just returned from a N night stay there ' d and were very pleased with our choice of hotel . we had a nice view of the chicago river and a portion of lake michigan and did not even request an upgraded view room . we had requested a slightly larger room because we had my son ' s wheelchair to store in the room and we were provided with a larger room which was certainly helpful and welcome since there were four of us staying five nights . the best part of the sheraton was the location . we were walking distance to practically everything in the city - navy pier , mag mile ( michigan ave ) , the loop , grant park , millennium park and even the museum area ( about N . N miles to them but totally walkable ) . we even walked to sears ( willis tower ) and john hancock building . the breakfast buffet at lb bistro was probably the best i ' ve ever had too ! 
the hotel is magnificent and is in an excellent location for doing anything in chicago . i was there for a conference and the facilities were excellent . free wi-fi , which is always good ! the room was clean and the view from the Nth floor was fantastic . friendly and helpful staff . great lobby for having a drink and meeting people . 
this hotel is in perfect location for anything you would like to do downtown . the hotel itself is amazing . i was in the historical tower and the rooms are beyond nice and the views are breathtaking . everyone was very helpful there especially victor at the concierge desk . 
we stayed here for N nights from N november and extended it for a further night . my wife secured the booking online for about usd N per night plus taxes , but because of very strong occupancy ( rsna conference ) we had to pay usd N for last unarranged night . i thought this was very reasonable for a central chicago hotel ( compared to sydney prices this was brilliant value ! ! ) and the weak usd helps us too . we were upgraded to a suite ( i suspect due to us being spg members ) and it was great . sure , there was no view but we focus more on the ability to sleep at night ( ie no noise ) and comfortable bed ( which was great ) . we were on level N of the N level building . big plus was the free wifi broadband internet . free coffee for the perculator also provided . i am not sure if it is the hotel ' s fault as to what tv services they subscribe to but what programs came out of the box in the evening was of very poor quality . hotel is many have said is in a great position - trader joes very handy for all those bits and pieces you need and great value too . my wife was attending two conferences ahead of the rsna one ( she is still in chicago but at a different hotel which had already been booked with another lady ) . so i walked everywhere as it was that handy - to the chicago history museum in the north to millenium park in the south ( take a bow chicagoeans - you have done a wonderful job in creating this - something to be remembered as being created at the turn of the century ) . thanksgiving day it snowed in the morning so i was a happy chappy coming from N degree celcius brisbane heat ! ! ) . we also recommend attending the piano bar - sat right next to the piano player from about Npm to just after midnight - absolutely brilliant ( pity people have to smoke though ! ! ) . this hotel will certainly be our first option when returning to chicago - i cannot understand why others need to pay usdN plus to get a little more . go past this hotel and you enter the state of diminishing returns . 
gorgeous lobby and staircase ! felt like i was walking onto the titanic ! hotel personnel were great and i thoroughly enjoyed " happy hour " ! i enjoyed the " chill " music in the lobby . felt like i was in a nice lounge . ) our room , on the other hand , was a complete turn off . extremely small , inconvenient , tacky decor overload . i guess i get the sizing of the room ( ssssssssooooooo small - N sq . ft . says the website ) since it is an old building but the decor was just fugly ! someone should ' ve mentioned to the " designer " that the darker the paint , the smaller the room appears . a blue room ? seriously ? website states , " design inspired by retro luxury cruise ships " . if they were going for a scene from the N ' s N ' s classic " the love boat " , i think they nailed it . the mirror in the room was useless since it had some dirt-like looking designs on them . i ' m assuming the age of the building had to do with the fact that the bathroom had no exhaust fan . god forbid i took a hot shower ! waiting about N minutes after to use the bathroom mirror was annoying . sink was small , useless , and you had to have the water running slowly otherwise it ' d splash everywhere . our ipod clock didn ' t work but we brought small speakers so we didn ' t miss it much ! the best thing about the room was that it made my husband and i not want to stay in there so we were out all day and night to avoid our roach motel of a room . i suggest you ask for anything but the queen king deluxe room unless you ' re by yourself and like to take cool showers . obtaining internet access is tedious . have to enroll into some loyalty program before gaining access . pretty dead in the area on weekends but thankful for the dunkin ' donuts next door ( hotel doesn ' t offer continental breakfast ) and the transit system , a hop , skip and away ! loved seeing dogs in the hotel but thought it was a tad much to allow dogs to sit on the couches . N-N min walk to michigan ave , N min walk to millennium park so no biggie ! ! ! hotel website states that self-park parking is N with in and out privileges . if you don ' t plan on driving ( my husband and i took cabs ) , then it ' s N without in and out privileges . the hotel is a N out of N , our room was a N out of N ( our bed was comfy at least ! ) . i think we got a good deal with the pricing of the hotel too so all in all , a decent experience . 
dana has surpassed all of my expectations . we arrived late on a friday night to spend a long holiday weekend in from the city from florida . the check in process was seamless and the front desk was very helpful with providing information . the only con was in reference to some of the shared areas to include the elevator seemed a little " worn " however , this was all overlooked once i stepped into our room with corner views of the city awesome ! 
i was visiting friends , when they had to leave for an unexpected family emergency . i was referred to the carlton inn- midway , and was pleasantly surprised with my visit ! warm and friendly staff , well maintained and clean , and convenient access to the orange line and downtown . felt like i had received more than the price i paid . . . thank you for the great stay ! ! we ' ll be back ! 
my husband and i booked this hotel for a saturday night through hotwire and were delighted to discover that it was walking distance from the goodman theater , the museum of the art institute , and the train station , the three places we planned needed to go . our room on the fifth floor was small , but tastefully decorated in a modern style , and it was equipped with everything we needed including free wifi and a coffee maker . other amenities included a comfortable king-size bed , flat-screen tv , desk , overstuffed chair , microwave and fridge . the bathroom had a large shower--no tub--and a blow dryer . the bathroom was fairly generously sized , though i wished there had been more counter space . near the elevators was a purified water dispenser and a rack of empty plastic bottles for helping ones self . we were not disturbed by noise during the night , either from outside or inside the hotel . the lobby features two self-check in stations , but there were also friendly helpful staff behind the desk for check in and out . there was a lounge , with a gas fireplace , off the lobby , where we waited for our bags to be brought down--the hotel was nice enough to keep them for us at no charge after we checked out so we could go to the museum unencumbered . there was also a restaurant bar off the lobby , but we didn ' t go there . we did avail ourselves of the seven-eleven conveniently located across the street . it was all that was open late saturday as we strolled back to the hotel after N pm . the starbucks downstairs was not open sunday morning , but there were a number of open cafes in the direction of the museum . the hotel is in an old , repurposed office building , but it has been completely redone . the hallways are narrow and the rooms are small , but this is a quality hotel . we would certainly stay there again . 
bed bugs . stay away . i am pretty forgiving when it comes to hotels . i always stay at chains with my rewards points but this was cheap , looked very nice on the website , and had the perfect location . since i was staying one night , i fugred , what the heck , take a chance . the hotel looks like the spent a lot of mone ymaking it look like a boutique in the lobby , but what they do spend on lobby decore they dont spend on cleaning staff or the room upkeep . the room was tiny , and the bathroom in this non-smoking room reeked of smoke . all of this i could forgive becayse it was one night and i wasn ' t spending much time in the room . the next morning i woke up with over N bed bug bites . they found the bugs after i left and say they have corrected the problem , but you dont get N bed bug bites unless its ben a problem for a very long time . it is one month later and i still have people asking me what all those red dots are on my arms . 
my sister and i were traveling and unable to get back east after the hurricane irene . traveling by train , from union station , just outside the station we could see a holiday inn . we took a chance and walked to this hotel . we we were delighted . the staff was very friendly and helpful . the hotel was clean . the attached restaurant was excellent . we would definitely stay again . 
nice little boutique hotel in a very good location for shopping , food and sight-seeing . the staff is friendly , especially the bellmen , and they do try to be helpful but there seems to be a lack of attention to detail . when a parcel arrived for us , there was no message from the front desk about its delivery . we had to ask before we received our parcel . the beds are very comfortable but there are a number of touches missing in the room . there are no coffee tea making facilities and no fridge either , so it is rather inconvenient if you want to have a drink without resorting to room service . there were also rather strange housekeeping practices that kept us intrigued but certainly not amused . the day after we arrived , housekeeping left a fresh set of toiletries in the bathroom , presumably to replace what we had already used on our first day there . however , we did not start on the new set of toiletries immediately as we hadn ' t finished the original lot . inexplicably , on subsequent days , one item after another disappeared from the bathroom . first the second tube of shampoo was removed from our room and then a tube of shower gel . in their place , we were given tube after tube of hair conditioner which we did not need or use ! this made us think that certain items were in short supply eg . the shampoo and others were in abundance , eg . the hair conditioner and the housekeeping staff had to keep juggling to make ends meet . despite these drawbacks , it is still a rather nice hotel and i would hope that the management would give attention to the shortcomings mentioned above . 
my friends and i stayed at the comfort suites april N-may Nnd . we got a great rate ( approximately N . N per night ) . we were heading to the cubs game on the Nth , and the front desk was kind enough to stow our bags in a locked room and everything was fine when we picked them up for check-in . the hotel is fairly close to an " l " line as we flew in from o ' hare . the hotel is also close to the red line ( wrigley field or us cellular field ) . location , this hotel for its price is unparalled . the room was quite large . we had a full kitchen , walk in closet , and desk area . i was under the impression each room had wi-fi , which it does not . hotel does provide ethernet cords . room also had flat screen tvs . we were given free hot breakfast each day ( saturday eggs , and bacon . sunday omlete and sausauge links . waffles are there each day ) . we didnt use the exercise equipment . the only drawback was the bathroom . i thought it was small , our toilet didnt flush occasionally , and my friend called for extra towels friday evening and someone told him that they were out . i asked saturday morning ( at Nam ) and had towels delievered within N minutes , so i am unsure about the difference N hours made in the towel situation . overall , i would definately stay here again . this is a great hotel for the value . the beds were great ( pillows were not ) . everyone was very friendly and the location to the magnificent mile is great for the price . you also have a N-N and cvs pharmacy very close by for any incidental needs . 
i had to be in chicago for business and the whole city was booked out . having left my booking till late , i found the prices were out of control ! i searched pricline and found two choices - a N star hotel and the westin north river - for the same price ! i chose the westin , but i was very concerned because of the bad reviews i read - especially highlighting poor service the reviewers had received . i can only say that those people must have picked the one day of the year that the service was less than exemplary . the location was fantastic , the room excellent and the service peerless . upon checkin i was automatically upgrade and given complementary breakfast the concierge organised a tour for me and followed up to see if i enjoyed it . the only downside was that i found out that all westins in north america are now non-smoking , but that too was a good thing as i had a great stay and cut down at the same time . i mentioned the poor reviews to the staff as i was leaving and told them how wrong the reviews were - they were really upset that some guests had not enjoyed the hotel . while the price at the time was high ( but still the same as a two star property was advertising ) i will definitely be staying here again . 
we got our laptops and a digital camera stolen the Nnd night we stayed there . . . . . the general manager never contacted us we never got any reports from them concerning the issue . all they offer was a free breakfast which is a joke since a night in this hotel is close to N a night ! ! i can buy my own breakfast any day ! ! ! ! ! ps . the staff and even the hotel president were indifferent and unprofessional regarding this issue ! ! ! worse experience ever ! ! ! ! 
six of us drove from toronto for a roadtrip to chicago the weekend of april N . after a long drive , we arrived at the hotel greeted by the doorman who was ready and eager to help us with our bags . the location of the hotel was perfect . walking distance to everywhere you wanted to go . it was great because i did not want to drive another kilometre while in the city . had my fill of driving to and fro . very close the michigan ave . magnificent mile . the hotel is surrounded by restaurants , shopping , nightlife and tourist spots . rooms we had N rooms for N people and it was perfect . the rooms were clean , tidy and nicely decorated . the hd tvs were a great touch . the towels were soft and the beds were firm . the rooms were on the smaller side . the staff was friendly and always helpful with directions , recommending restaurants and other points of interest . the hotel offers free continental breakfast every morning which is perfect if you are on the go and complimentary coffe , tea and hot chocolate throughout the day . the lobby is beautiful and welcoming with plenty of places to sit and meet . overall , my friends and i had a pleasant experience and i would stay there again . 
i booked a stay at the hard rock for my partner and i for valentine ' s day . we live in chicago and wanted to do a little something different to make the holiday special . we had heard good things about the hard rock and gave it a try . i was a little skeptical because of the association with the hard rock cafes , but i couldn ' t have been more wrong . the hotel was sleek , stylish and inviting . the rooms were very nice , clean and comfortable . the staff was professional and friendly and even upgraded our stay for free . the only slight letdown was our meal in china grill , which we felt was overpriced for the quality . sometimes less is more , if you know what i ' m saying . i was , however , impressed by some of the cocktails in the hotel bar , which were very innovative and delicious . overall , i was pleasantly suprised by the hard rock and will book my parents a room for their next chicago visit . 
we were pleasantly surprised by the palomar and it outdid our expectations . they were overbooked when we checked in so instead of our double queen standard room we were upgraded to a king suite with a pullout couch . the young woman in reception could not have been nicer , and wanted to make sure the upgrade was okay . it was perfect with the wild storms we have been unfortunately having this summer , the upgrade was oh so welcome ! the room was clean , the bathroom was amazing ! loved the bath products too ! ate breakfast at the restaurant , which they gave us a partial comp for and everything was delicious . wine reception was very nice and again because of the weather , it was crowded and the staff was always polite would recommend this hotel to anyone ! 
the conrad hilton recently took over this property from the failed meridian hotel . it seems that the conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesn ' t work . the entrance is very difficult to find . there are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby . as a result , there was often a line waiting for them . the same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area . if you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay , you will find the poor elevator layout annoying . the king room is what i would consider small compared to other chicago hotels . although i like modern design , the room was quite stark and cold . it was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear . the bathroom was the best part . has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk ? it was the most uncomfortable set-up i ' ve experienced . the views are non-existent for most of the rooms . in a city with amazing vistas , this was disappointing . i saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them . room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay . excellent food and high quality presentation . sorry i couldn ' t write a better review . would i stay here again ? no . chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them . 
pros - close to the airport , complimentart shuttle - N minute walk to the train - large clean rooms - fridge in the room cons - N ( after tax ) per day per parking spot - N per day for an internet connection in the room - restaurant in the hotel is not exactly " budget friendly " ( about N per person ) - downtown chicago is about a N minute train ride away . luckily , we got a good deal on this hotel via priceline . the bed was not what i have come to expect of mariott . i have stayed at many other mariott hotels and have found their beds really nice . . . not in this one . the service was ok , but not super . staying there , it felt as if the hotel is taking the business they get from the airport for granted and the staff does little to nothing to make your stay memorable in any way . 
the millennium knickerbocker is in a prime location . the hotel is one block from the magnificent mile , and all of the great shopping , restaurants , sites that michigan avenue has to offer . lake michigan is a mere two blocks away , and the lake walking biking path is easily accessed through a walking tunnel under the street ( completely safe ) . two blocks south of the hotel is the famous hancock building ( go to the bar and or restaurant at the top ) and its amazing views of the lake and city . the water tower is about N blocks south of the hotel as well . some of my favorite restaurants are steps away from the hotel ( nomi in the park hyatt , le colonial , rosebud steakhouse ) . during christmas this area is beautifully decorated . the famous drake hotel is directly across from the knickerbocker as well . the rooms in the knickerbocker are small , but nice . the lobby can get a bit crowded at times , but the location is hard to beat , and the price is right compare to most magnificent mile hotels . 
my husband was here for a conference , so my teenage daughter and i joined him for a long weekend . our room was comfortable- the sleeping area and bathroom area were seperated by a hallway- that made it nice for whoever gets up early not to disturb the sleeping occupants quite so much . i ' m not sure how all the rooms are configured , but i really liked ours . nice touch- digital thermostat to control the temp . concierge staff was helpful . likewise the front desk . my only complaint was the restaurant , aria . my daughter and i visited their breakfast buffet on a friday morning . there were no plates in the buffet line and it didn ' t appear anyone was paying attention to refilling items that had been eaten . i asked an attendant , who said they were " washing the plates " , waited about N minutes , and went back only to find- still no plates . i asked our waiter , who then asked someone else . . . . really ? ? ? a restaurant with no clean plates ? ? ? for the price ( N ) , i expected a nice buffet with lots of choices and someone refilling the pans of food and bowls of cream cheese for my bagel . definitely a waste of money . 
we loved the modern elegance and simplicity of our room complimented by rock and roll art and artifacts . the service was excellent and the ambiance of the lobby coupled with a nightcap in the lounge made for an excellent end to a perfect long weekend in chicago . i highly recommend this hotel . 
very good location , just off north michigan avenue and magnificent mile . it ' s also just round the corner from joe ' s seafood steak house which is a bit of an institution ( need to book ) or alternatively it ' s not far from sullivan ' s or fleming ' s who also do great steaks . we didn ' t eat in the hotel but it had a nice restaurant on the terrace which seemed popular during the day for working lunch . the ethos of the hotel seems to be low key but luxury - staff are very polite and helpful . we had a standard room which wasn ' t huge but perfectly fine . would definitely stay there again . 
my husband and i loved our stay at this hotel . from check-in to check-out , the staff was great . they all were friendly and accommodating and truly wanted to help in anyway . we loved our suite . . . it was clean and well appointed . the hotel still has so much character even with a recent re-do . we were surprised by an unadvertised new year ' s eve party at midnight consisting of a jazz trio , balloon drop and champagne toast . . . free . it really was a fun time . breakfast in the restaurant was outstanding . . . our waiter was terrific and anticipated our every need plus , the food was wonderful . the only downside was the pricey parking . 
we choose to stay at the dana hotel because of its fantastic location and my wife wanted to try their spa . first , the spa was average to slightly above average , however pricing was higher than average . very friendly staff , however they did not have the appropriate equipment ( for example , massage for my wife was pre natal , however they did not have a pre natal table , no massage chair for pedi , etc . ) if you are expecting a canyon ranch experience , keep looking . second , the hotel room was ok . nice furniture ( comfortable couch and desk ) , and good amenities ( nice bedding , reasonable wine and snacks ) . housekeeping left a lot to be desired ( dried toothpaste on vanity top , green mystery substance on mirror , and hair on floor and walls in bathroom ) . also , you can hear every step ( or other . . . " movements " ) your upstairs neighbor takes . a major point of annoyance was the fact that housekeeping came at N N am on the day we were checking out . we were not even awake yet ! after almost falling back to sleep , there was another knock at the door , this time to restock the mini bar . check out time is at noon ! we just wanted to sleep in a bit , but it seems that the hotel staff had no intention of granting us this guilty pleasure . with so many other outstanding hotels in chicago at this price point , we probably would not make dana our choice again . 
this getaway was for our anniversary . the service received at the seneca was over our expectations . firstly i booked with expedia and got a very good deal ( under N night ) with breakfast included . when we arrived we had a complimentary upgrade to a complete suite ( it was like a real appartment ( full kitchen , dining room , living room , bedroom with N beds , N tv ( one in living room and N in the room and N bathrooms ! ! ) the person at the desk was very helpful ( after upgrading our room , he help us for booking architectural cruise for us and explain where to find good restaurant in the neighborhood . he also printed our boarding pass because the printer at the office space did ' nt work . the seneca is located just in front of the john hancock center , so we went up twice ( day and night ) to see the city and just N block of the magnificent mile and wakable distance from millenium park , oak beach , gold coast neighboorhood and old town . my wow was for sure the complimentary upgrade ! if i return to chicago , for sure i will stay at the seneca again ! 
i recently stayed at the club quarters wacker at michigan for three nights while i attended a conference a few blocks away . the location is good , right on the river , and across from the trump tower and wrigley building . it ' s within walking distance of public transport el , and the price is extremely reasonable for the area . while the price was great , my room was pretty small--not really a problem since i was busy outside of the hotel during most of my visit . i was expecting the room to be small anyway since i ' ve stayed at other club quarters hotels and have had similar sized rooms , but nothing this tiny . i couldn ' t have the bathroom door ( which opened out ) and the closet door open at the same time . that said , the view from my room ( Nnd floor ) was great . the hotel lobby area is kind of awkward since it shares space with the river hotel . make sure you get on the correct elevator since there are separate sets for each hotel ! 
the hotel is just fine for a business stay - it is moderately clean ( see below ) and the staff do seem to care about your stay . nonetheless something is wrong when you can ' t open the toilet seat because the toilet paper roll is in the way . i had to take the toilet paper out in order to open and close the toilet lid . when i am traveling on business i do not need a lot of space but this is too much . the other complaint is that the halls and sometimes the rooms smell of dirty vacuum cleaners . otherwise things seemed clean . finally , i have found that between room service , the hotel restaurant , wifi , etc . that the price can jack up pretty quickly from the base rate . these amenities are not inexpensive and i wish i had just booked a place that had a higher base rate but wasn ' t as pricey in the end . 
my wife and i stayed at the whitehall hotel for the N nights immediately following labor day weekend this year and could not have been more pleased . the location is amazing ( N N block from hancock tower , N block from water tower , N block from rush st . , N blocks from red line . . . ) , the price was incredible , the staff was pleasant and helpful and the restaurants and bar are comfortable and offer good food and drinks at affordable prices . of special note is the old lounge -- felt like having drinks in a big . , comfy living room - perfect for unwinding after running around chicago all day . we will definitely stay here again ! ! 
well located , not too far from the lake or the magnificent mile . . . good , comfortable rooms and met my expectations in most respects . wifi was expensive , and very poor speeds didn ' t eat at the hotel restaurants so can ' t comment on the food . 
we stayed N nights at the omni for " spring break , " and had a great time in spite of the snow . location was perfect and having the suite set-up worked well with the kids . service was excellent - very friendly and helpful . we enjoyed the select guests benefits of free wireless internet and the morning beverage service with optional add-on bagels ( for a fee ) . cookies and milk were delivered with the turndown service . the cookies won ' t win any awards , but it was a nice gesture . the pool is not as large or impressive as some , but the kids enjoyed it every night nonetheless . workout facility is on the small side but clean and well-kept , and i never had to wait for a treadmill ( there are N ) . we will stay here again . 
what can i say good about this hotel ? not much . i ended up being next to a family with a screaming kid . the parents couldn ' t keep him quiet , and due to the extreme paper thin walls i heard every word of their conversation , as well as the screaming child all night . and i ' m not exagerrating . . . it was the worst from Nam to N Nam . now , this of course isn ' t the hotels fault . . . . but i asked to be moved to another room , and they wouldn ' t do it . they would send up security that wouldn ' t do anything . i asked for a refund at the front desk due to the terrible experience , and got N off my bill . whoopie ! really quite mean people . next up was the toilet , it was broken , and wouldn ' t stop running . . . . so i had to open the tank and shove a pen in the stopper so it would shut up . then there ' s the room . . . i get in , and the ac had been running continuously , so it was freezing . also the front of the hotel was lined with picketers ! i really can ' t say enough bad things about this hotel . . . . stay far far away
my husband and i just returned from a N night stay at the affinia . although the hotel is still undergoing renovation and there is no restuarant bar amenity , there are so many other pluses about this place that make it a stand out . first , all the staff were very accommodating , second the location is outstanding , and third the room with luxurious bedding made it difficult to get out of bed . we were told that by april a seafood restaurant will be ready--i am sure it too will pay attention to details . we can ' t wait to return ! also want to comment on restaurant reviews i read at this site--quartino ' s was right on . if you love tuna tartare poke sushi we did taste tests and enjoyed those appetizers at bandera , catch N and roys . 
the location was perfect . so close to milennium park and the art institute . staff was wonderful , very helpful and friendly . breakfast was great , nice to have so many options , and they always refilled as needed . room very clean and very quiet . we had a refrigerator and a microwave which came in handy during our stay for the week . would go back to this hotel anytime . 
evalyn at the front desk was extremely welcoming when we checked in . after we checked out i noticed they still had a hold on my card even though i paid cash for the room . i called and spoke with evalyn she was more than happy to help out , and never once was rude about it . i will go out of my way to stay in the ' burbs ' again just because of her awesome customer service ! 
stayed at the amalfi over easter weekend with my wife and daughter . first visit to chicago so we wanted a great location with easy access to everything . the amalfi was perfect in that regard as it is right in the heart of chicago . walking distance to the magnificent mile , millenium park , great restaurants and coffee shops , and public transit . but what really did it was the hotel itself . we had a beautiful , spacious , comfortable room with N queen size beds . breakfast is served on every floor - awesome idea ! and the social hour every evening with appetizers and cocktails was great . the staff was extremely helpful with directions , suggestions , etc . absolutely perfect stay and all for N a night - hard to believe ! ! one small note is that we used their valet parking and ditched the car for the entire stay . they charge N a day which may appear steep but in researching the area , it ' s well in line with downtown fees . don ' t let this spoil your stay in this great hotel . 
from the moment we arrived , everyone was not only helpful but went the extra to make sure we felt special . guess what , we did ! one person in particular , jamie torres , ( i believe her title is ipo greeter ? ) went out of her way to make us feel at home and our stay memorable . everyone greeted us with smiling faces no matter what time of day or how busy they were . our room was comfortable and everything we needed was quickly taken care of . we will definitely visit again and will recommend the " w " to friends and family visiting chicago . 
great experience in chicago . hotel was gorgeous in the lobby . rooms were fairly small though . had the air turned down to N and the window opened in february and room felt like an oven . bed are very firm with too many overstuffed pillows . had a great view from the Nst floor over rush st . it was a good stay but we have had nicer rooms for the same price in chicago . 
we were very excited for our stay at the palmer house in downtown chicago as we had heard wonderful things about it . our stay started off very rocky . we called ahead to make arrangements for the room because we were going to arrive very late ( after N N pm ) with three small children ( N , N N ) . we spoke with a woman at the front desk and asked that we have a pack n play or crib ready in the room . i was told " no problem " . i also asked if they had down pillows or comforters . i was told that yes they did . i asked if one of the beds have the down removed . she replied " would you like us to make the entire room down-free ? that would be no problem . " i told her that would be wonderful . upon our arrival at about N N i asked the man working the front desk if they had prepared the room for us with a crib and removal of the down comforters and pillows . he said that they had not , but did see that the request was noted on our reservation . he said they ' d have someone up right away . we went to our room and did our best to settle in given that we could not put our baby in a crib . we removed the down pillows and comforterfrom one bed and put them in a pile while we waited for housekeeping to arrive . after N minutes i attempted to call the front desk from the phone located between the beds . the front desk answered and i asked for a status update on the cribs and pillows . i received no answer and the front desk hung up . about N seconds later , i received a call from the front desk asking if i had received the materials i requested . i stated that i had not , but then the man at the front desk hung up . it became apparent to me that they could not hear me and that the phone receiver must be broken . they called back right away and i answered the phone on the desk ( thankfully they had two phones ) . the man at the front desk seemed shocked that they had not yet delivered the crib and pillows and said that they would be up right away . i also informed him that the phone between the beds was apparently not working . ( the defective phone was not replaced during our stay ) . N minutes later we received a knock on the door . they had brought the crib , but no pillows . we informed housekeeping that we had also asked for a down-free room . they left and came back about five minutes later with the pillows . so , we got off to a rocky start to say the least . ( note a previous review stated that the palmer house charged extra for a crib . that was not the case for our stay as the crib was free ) . the room itself was ok . not very big , but that ' s to be expected in downtown chicago . it seemed a bit dated with a tube tv . the heating cooling was not the best . we had to turn the thermostat down to the coldest setting possible just so we didn ' t burn up . we also cracked the window to cool it down a bit . ( it was N degrees outside ) . the lobby was beautiful ! there were many people just lounging around having drinks and taking in the beauty of the place . the location was great ! it was just across from milennium park . there was a starbucks , corner bakery , mcdonalds and dunkin donuts all right there for breakfast . we were also very close to the el , which was great for hitching a ride to the north end of the magnificent mile , but it was quite loud . the concierge was helpful providing directions and a map of downtown . unfortunately , the palmer house charged an arm and a leg for internet and offered wired only in the room . too bad ipad iphone users . i utilized the Ng on my cell phone instead . not sure why these older hotels don ' t get with the times . strange that your cheaper hotels include internet for free . i guess if you ' re willing to pay for an expensive hotel , you don ' t mind the extra for internet ( and parking for that matter , which was not cheap ) . on day two we checked out the swimming pool . it was a decent size and had both a shallow and deep end . unfortunately , someone had detached the safety rope dividing these two sections making it too easy to meander to the sloped part of the pool on the way to the deep end . not the safest thing for kids . the water was warm enough . they seemed to have a bit of a drainage problem on the pool deck as there was a lot of standing water that was very cold . they had plenty of towels for guests to use and a number of chairs and tables . we didn ' t try the restaurant and opted instead for delivery from giordano ' s pizza . overall , we had a nice stay , but it was not nearly as good as previous stays in downtown chicago . i do not think we ' ll be back . 
staffed by a lovely bunch of folks , the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is coming apart at the seams . the yet to be completed renovations cannot be finished soon enough . if you ' re sensitive to mold , then do yourself a favour and check your bathroom carefully for mold upon entering your guestroom for the first time . the first guestroom that i was put in had a bad black mold problem in addition to it being in a state of disrepair . the guestroom to which i was subsequently moved also had a mold issue and was similarly less than ideal , but i was too busy to move again . i did let a woman on the reception desk know about the second mold problem upon check out , however . it seems likely that renovated guestrooms are handed out only by special request and even then they are necessarily subject to availability unless you ' ve got some kind of status with sheraton or you ' ve paid a top rate . both of the rooms that i saw were dated and a bit tatty . cleanliness also seems to be a problem . i found a few glaring cleanliness issues during my stay at the hotel , but i discussed only three of them with hotel associates . how hair finds itself smeared on to a bathroom ceiling is beyond me ! it could have gotten there by the hand of a guest as easily as it did a dirty housekeeping or maintenance rag , but the point is that it shouldn ' t be on the ceiling at all . look , i know that it has to be very difficult to keep guestrooms clean and i take care to leave a couple of bucks for housekeeping cleaners every day , but hair on the ceiling ? in my many decades of travelling , that ' s a first for me . it was a bit of a shock in a hotel of this calibre . if you ' ll be driving a great deal while in chicago , then please do know that as of the date of this review and unless otherwise indicated on the meter pay station or by signs posted in the neighbourhood , you can park on the street for free around the hotel from N N p . m . at night until N N a . m . the following morning . for those arriving late and leaving early throughout their stay , this can amount to a significant savings . empty your car of any valuables and provided it isn ' t a fancier late model vehicle , it should be safe enough on the streets of streeterville over night . street parking is available on the ramp descending from reception or on the streets below the elevated reception level of the hotel , which streets can be accessed from the reception level by a set of stairs at the end of east north water street . parking in this manner saved me anywhere from N to N during my stay . 
you can ' t be any more convenient to midway airport . the shuttle service is great . the room was very clean and very comfortable . the breakfast was excellent , possibly the best breakfast i have ever had at a hotel . the food was high quality and the preparation was perfect . 
this is my first choice as a marriott platinum elite member when traveling in chicago . located on the blue line near o ' hare , the price is always very competitive and the rooms are well appointed for business travel . although they offer a great shuttle service to and from o ' hare , i choose to take the blue line as it stops in the parking lot of the hotel . check out this property the next time you are in chicago . 
first of all , let me mention that i travel often for business and this is the first time i ' ve ever felt strongly enough about a hotel to actually take the time to review it . this place is not what they advertise it to be . they call themselves a " boutique hotel . " it ' s not . the rooms and service are the equivalent of any crappy two-star hotel . but that is not the biggest problem . the biggest problem is the location . in short , it is not safe . the hotel is about a N-N minute walk from the chinatown l stop . the area around chinatown is bustling and colorful and definitely worth exploring . but , the hotel is not in chinatown . as soon as you walk one block from the l towards the hotel , you are in a run-down , ghetto . and it doesn ' t just look unsafe . it is unsafe . a man followed me as i walked from the l to the hotel around the corner of state and Nrd st . when i let him pass in front of me , he waited at a bus stop until i passed and then continued to follow me . when i turned to face him to acknowledge that he was following me , he insisted on " walking with me . " i got on my cell phone with my boyfriend but that did not deter him . i started to get nervous as we were getting further away from any other people . that ' s when i hailed a cab to the hotel . there are a lot of people just " hanging out " on that corner ( which is a bunch of boarded up store fronts and an empty lot ) and once you turn on to state , you have a N minute walk down a pretty empty street until you get to the hotel . it ' s a perfect situation for someone to get raped or mugged . that ' s the worst of it , but that ' s only the beginning . . . i ' ll try to sum up the rest . service is not exactly rude . . . more like sedated . . . it took the guy at the counter over N minutes to check me in while a line formed behind me b c he couldn ' t find my reservation and although there were other people hanging out behind the counter , they were not helping him . . . or anyone else . there is no restaurant at ( or near ) the hotel and also no refrigerators in the room , so dining in is challenging . i brought some food back from chinatown but had to fill a bucket with ice to keep it cold . the vending machines on several floors had no water left in them . . . to get drinking water i had to go to the water cooler in their " state-of-the-art " fitness room ( it ' s not state-of-the-art ) . in short , this place is ghetto trying to sell itself as chic . from the disgruntled looks i noticed on the faces of other guests , i assume i ' m not the only one that was deceived by the website and expected something completely different for the price . the one positive thing i can say is that the bathtub in my room was huge , which was a nice way to decompress after an unpleasant evening spent here at chicago south loop hotel . 
we got this place for a steal on priceline ( N a night ) . it was very centrally located in the loop and was very close to shops , restaurants and river . it was a very large hotel that obviously accommodates to chicago tourists . we were there during a cubs home game and the lobby was filled with cubs fans . the facilities were very clean , staff was super nice and the rooms clean ( our bed was temperpedic ) . the down sides were anything extra you need at the hotel ( wifi , food , or business center ) is very expensive . you would be better suited to stop at the walgreens or N-N a block away to get food and or drinks . internet was N for Nmins . they did , however , have free plane check in computers . all in all , this was one of our favorite places we have stayed ( we travel to chicago every year to visit family ) . 
i had a great experience at the ritz carlton . i was hosting a group of professors and journalists for a television panel and looked at several hotels before choosing the rc . i had a feeling that the service would be the most personal there and i was not disappointed . the staff was attentive and friendly , just the right amount of attention without being too much . the rooms are spotless and comfortable , the views of chicago and the lake are beautiful , the lobby and restaurant feel modern and welcoming and the work out room and pool are lovely . the beds are super comfortable and the air conditioning is quiet and consistent . no fans going on and off all night ! there is complimentary wifi but a high speed connection is N per day . during our stay , we had a few people forget things in their rooms or in the lobby and the problems were solved easily and graciously with one phone call to hotel security . we ate several meals in the restaurant and there was a good selection of smaller plates and entrees to make everyone happy . the mixed drinks were expensive but the dinner prices were reasonable . the hotel is above a mall where there are lots of choices for quick food so that was a good option for those who wanted to grab something and go . the location of the hotel is central to michigan avenue and the lake which was nice for out of towners who wanted to walk and see a few sights . i would highly recommend the hotel for business or pleasure and will definitely return . 
i reserved this hotel through priceline ' s name your own price so i didn ' t know what hotel i was staying at until i paid . i have stayed at hotel indigo in vernon hills before and remember how nice and inviting it was . i called the night before since check in wasnt until N , but i had luggage with me and had afternoon plans before and wanted to make sure i could drop my stuff off early and the guy on the phone said yes . so it was nice i was able to drop my things off and not worry about it . the girl at the desk wasn ' t necessarily rude but she wasn ' t friendly . when i did come back to check in , i asked if i could have a later check out and the rep said i could , but i had to sign up for the rewards program . which i did since it was free , but i found that a little annoying , just a simple request for a late check required me to be a rewards member . when i arrived to my room , it was smaller than i expected but it wasn ' t cramped . it was very inviting , bright and clean . about N minutes after i was in , the front desk called to make sure everything was okay . a few things i noticed , once of the bed side lamps didn ' t work . . . not a big deal , i used the other one . the lamp on the side table wasn ' t even plugged in which was weird . the maginfying makeup mirror didn ' t light up as well , but it was nice they had that to do eyemakeup . i loved that the bathroom had a nice shelf all along the mirror to make up for no vanity . the shower was nice however , the pressure could have better and the shampoo and conditioner weren ' t the best either . i used the hair dryer in the room . . . but it was blowing out cold air ! i called the front desk and within N minutes someone brought me a new one that worked much better ! the bed was extremely comfortable . . . i slept like a baby . i just wish the curtains were better at covering the window , i had too much sun coming in this morning that woke me up early than i wanted . also , the tv is set up kinda high , so you have to raise the remote up at an awkward level to change the channels . i did take a look at the menu in the room for the restaurant downstairs and the prices seemed reasonable . however i did not order food , so i can ' t write about the quality . in the morning , it seems like the doors slam behind guests so that was also annoying as i ' m trying to sleep in the morning with the doors being shut . overall , i would come back and recommend it to others . it is a great location . . . only a block away from the red line ( clark and division ) , less than a N cab ride to union station . 
we stayed in late june while the hotel was undergoing renovations in some of the public rooms . the staff were excellent and the suite was very comfortable , quiet and had a view over east superior street . there was one occasion when work started early but when i mentioned this the workmen were stopped and it didn ' t happen again . this hotel is in a prime location for shops , restaurants and the magnificent mile . 
romantic , funky hotel . lots to do in the neighborhood , or a N minute walk to the river or greektown . staff was helpful
the hotel room and bathroom are clean , small , but enough for what we needed we only wanted to sleep and wash , so for that purpose is ok . beds are comfortable , breakfast is good cereal , yogurt , coffee , juices , eggs , bacon , different types of bread , fruit . . . location is great , you can walk to several tourist places in chicago and the train station and bus stops are just a block away , so is very convenient . what we didn t like is we stayed in the second floor and next to us were very noisy people for our N day stay . i was with my kids and the neighbors were single men , so ask not to check with these kind of travelers , because you won t sleep , we could hear all the conversation of these people . they were opening and closing doors all night . i guess because the corridors are very narrow . . . 
nice classic hotel , but doing business or work in this hotel is awful . internet blocked if available , no wifi in rooms . stop in in the lobby for ambiance , then head to a real hotel to get your work done . 
we have just spent N very enjoyable days staying at this super hotel , in a great location in the heart of wonderful chicago . our suite was attractive , spacious and very comfortable - with views of the john hancock tower - just a couple of blocks away . my husband particularly appreciated the twin tvs ! the staff were friendly , helpful and welcoming . my only minor ciriticism is that the electric wiring needs looking at . half the lamps in our room did not work . 
just got back from a N night stay at the talbott . it was terrific . the location is superb , a bit outside the bigger touristy locations , but still within easy walking distance of restaurants , shopping and all the sites we wanted to visit . we originally booked for two people , but a friend decided to join us . the hotel swapped our original room for a double queen room - at no extra charge ! the staff were friendly , helpful and ready to do anything to make the stay a good one . those loaner umbrella ' s in the lobby came in handy to the afternoon showers that hit every day . the room itself was quite large - with a good sized bathroom . the beds were good and the linens quite comfortable . the view wasn ' t great - we looked out at a wall - but we spent so little time in the room that it really didn ' t make much of a difference - and no complaints because we got that double queen room we really needed . i ' d recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable stay . yes the price is more than you ' d pay for a " basic " hotel . . . but totally worth it from my point of view . 
if you want N star luxury then go pay the N star luxury prices . if you want something reasonable in the heart of downtown then this is for you ! we were in walking distance to just about everything despite the weather ( N N N-N N N ) . . . restaurants , bars , theatres , shopping . taxis were always readily available if needed for further away tourist type stuff and would definitely recommend you use them or other public transport as you will pay and arm a leg to park pretty much everywhere . yes , the rooms are on the smaller side and there is no iron in the room , but what a great use of space , modern ammenities and the ' community closet ' is well equipped with the iron and ironing board . if something was needed that was not in the closet , we called the front desk and received it with in N-N minutes if that long . they do start with the minimum . . . if you ' re staying two to a room then you get two pillows , two towels , etc . however , if you need anything the staff is on it . the staff was very knowledgeable and very helpful with everything we needed and wanted . really can ' t say enough about the staff . . . great job to you all ! ! overall , we definitely got what we paid for and beyond . we will definitely be staying here again on future visits to the windy city ! ! 
we chose to stay at this hotel because it was very close to a business meeting we had to attend early in the morning . our reservations were made last-minute , and it was a good thing i brought the printed confirmation because the hotel had no records of the N rooms we had reserved . i was the first of our party to check in , and had less than N N hour to make it to another meeting N blocks away . although the two ladies at the front desk couldn ' t find the reservation , they did give me a room and promised to contact the travel agent to clear up the confusion . it appears that the problem was resolved because the other two travelers had no problems when they checked in a few hours later . the rooms are small , and we ( i was with my husband ) were given a room with one full-size bed . the bathroom was tiny and the floor had water spots - at least i hope it was water given the close proximately to the toilet ( the spots were very easy to see on the black tile ) . otherwise , it was clean and nicely maintained . it did have an unusual square sink that was set slighty above the countertop , which was an unexpected change from the normal " hotel " bathroom sink . the stopper in the sink was closed and refused to open without being pried up . there was no lever to lift it and if it was the " pop-up " type ( where you push down and it pops up ) , the pop-up function had ceased to work . luckily i figured that out before i brushed my teeth and or i would have had to pry it up through a sink full of water and spit . after my meeting , i was dying of hunger and wanted to order some food , but found that we were missing the book with the room service menu . it was quickly delivered after a call to the front desk . room service was right on time and the food was above average . we had to make a second call to the front desk because the tv refused to work . a maintenance man appeared shortly thereafter and was able to fix the problem . the bed was uncomfortable with a hump in the middle , which caused me to roll towards the edge of the bed all night . i definitely did not have a good night s sleep . however , the other travelers in our group did not have an issue with their bed , so it may have been just my bed . overall , i have stayed in far worse hotels . it was clean and was not over-priced . it would have been nicer not to have the three issues ( no record of the reservation , no room service menu , tv not working ) , but all of the staff members we dealt with were courteous and the problems were quickly resolved . the biggest negative was the uncomfortable bed , and since i was the only one with that problem , it appears that not all beds in this hotel were created equally . 
stayed here for two nights on a weekend trip , chose the hotel based on two good stays at the affinia gardens nyc . the staff at the front desk on check-in--peter and simon--were the most friendly and helpful staff i ' ve met so far in my travels . when they heard it was my first trip to chicago they loaded me up with maps , advice on what to see based on my interests , and in the evenings when i returned the hotel they ' d ask how my day was and what i saw . very genuine and helpful . i booked the smallest room type , but was told on check-in that there was an issue and that i would be upgraded to a suite--exciting ! the room was spotless and nicely decorated--photos of chicago landmarks on the walls , a cool burnt orange-y wall covering in the bathroom that made the room glow peachy-pink . affinia hotels win for highest density of electrical outlets in a room ( e . g . N outlets in a N ft sq area around the bed ) and most mirrors in a room--very practical . an assortment of philosophy toiletries are provided , they are green tea lotion ( thick , nice as hand lotion ) , lime blossom shampoo and body soap , and blackberry musk conditioner ( smells good ) . my room at the front of the hotel overlooked superior and st clair and was very quiet at night and there were controls in the room to adjust the room temperature precisely . there ' s a business center on the Nnd floor with N computers where you can print your boarding pass . no free wifi , alas . the location is great--about N blocks from the chicago-red line station and half a block from michigan avenue . gino ' s east pizza is right next door . overall , i was very happy with my stay and would return . 
my husband and i have stayed at hotel felix multiple times and we love it . we used to live in chicago , but now when we visit the city , we always choose the felix . the location can ' t be beat - just a few blocks walk to michigan avenue for great shopping and restaurants , and the room rates are very reasonable . the felix feels like a smaller , warmer version of your typical w hotel - modern and elegant , but also very welcoming . accomodations are comfortable , room service food is good , spa services are delightful ( and aveda ! ) , and the hotel staff is always helpful and pleasant . we ' ll definitely be back ! 
i travel to chicago every few months on business and i ' ve stayed at most of the hotels on or near michagan avenue . while i can ' t say that there was anything too wrong with the room ( i had a king deluxe - newly renovated " room for about ( N ) i will say that the room was really , really average . it was a small room on the Nth floor . my view was of the hancock bldg ' s parking structure and a sliver of michagan ave . there was nothing special about about the room at all . it had a flat screen tv . i found a hair on the toilet seat which i really didn ' t appreciate . if i had to choose something in the same price range i would tell people to stay at the sofitel or the affinia hotels as they both offer much more appealing rooms , great service and offer a far more interesting environment . if you are looking for a very bland hotel with a good location ( keep in mind that the affinia and sofitel offer virtually the same location as they are both within a block or two ) then this is your place . if you like nicer quality rooms and service then you may want to consider another hotel . 
my husband and i stayed at the wyndham for N nights in early june N while visiting our son , who had been attending college in chicago . i booked the special " take your daughter to chicago - american girl package , " which offered a rate of N . N a night for a standard room , a N savings over the regular room rate . i booked a room with N double beds , as we thought our son might want to stay with us . the package included a wyndham bathrobe which fits an american girl doll . when i checked in , i discovered that the hotel had changed our reserved room with N double beds to one with only a king sized bed , because that was my preference when i joined wyndham byrequest . if we wanted our son to stay with us , we had to pay a N a night fee for a rollaway bed . i was tired after driving almost N miles that day and didn ' t have the energy to protest . i did not get any kind of upgrade for being a byrequest member , although i did get a free small bottle of wine and a cheese and cracker snack . our room was on the Nth floor , and was on the small side , but was adequate . as a byrequest member , i did not have to pay the N . N fee for internet access . the room had a queen sized bed ( not the promised king sized bed ) , a small sitting area with a chair and a desk , and a refrigerator mini bar . it was clean and quiet i did hear a conversation from a guest in the next room , but did not hear any street noise . my son decided not to stay with us , so i asked the front desk to remove the rollaway bed about an hour after it had been delivered . this was done promptly , but when i checked out , i was charged N . N for N night ' s use , which i had to ask to be removed from the bill . when we first went to our room ( around N pm ) , there was a full bottle of beer in the hall by the door and there were dirty dishes and an empty beer box outside several other rooms which were not cleared until the next day . housekeeping is quite slow on the second day of our stay , our room was not cleaned until almost N pm . the hotel is in a great location , within walking distance of shopping and many area attractions . i highly recommend the delicious food at the corner bakery , located across the street . overall , this hotel was fine , but it is really not a N star hotel . i would stay here again if i got a good rate . 
this is a nice hotel in a good location of chicago but there were some problems we had which have turned us off ever staying there again . on the plus side , the staff are friendly and helpful the rooms are comfortable and clean ( even though the plumbing system in the bathroom really needs to be updated-showering in water up to my ankles is not fun ) the food in the restaurant is terrific , and the fact that it actually had a bar was a real plus for us . the problems with check-in and check-out are ridiculous . the bottle neck created by the queue of people trying to move around make it very awkward to speak to the receptionists . we also needed to send a fax from the hotel ( something i have had no trouble doing in other hotels ) but we were charged N just to send it , i personally thought this was a little extreme . we asked if we could store our bags for an hour while we went to eat breakfast in the hotel restaurant and we were charged Nc per bag to store them . i have never had to pay for a luggage room before , and i heard others around us complaining about the same thing . the dinner we had in the hotel restaurant was delicious , but it was when we paid our bill that we got ticked off . though the waitress and the service were excellent , she placed our bill on the table before we finished eating , leaving out much chance of having a drink or dessert after dinner . what really annoyed us was that she had already added a gratuity of N onto the bill before we got it . i can understand this being automatically added to a bill when its a large party , but i ' ve never seen it done when it ' s a party of N . the other thing that annoyed me was , as far as im concerned , is tipping not something that ' s supposed to be at the discretion of the customer ? since when did the waiters and waitresses start deciding how good they are at their jobs ? we had fully intended in leaving her an excellent tip that suitably reflected the service but what if our service had been terrible-were we just expected to tip her regardless ? all in all the hidden charged we incurred during our stay really put us off staying here again . 
for the past five years we have booked N-N rooms at the w-lakeshore for our yearly ( sometimes bi-yearly ) shopping vacations . we love the view , and the atmosphere , and the location . we are always catered to and the service is very kind . the hotel rooms are cleaned and well cared for . and if we want an upgrade they almost always upgrade us right away , and if not they offer it a day or so after we have arrived . we travel with N- adults N- teenager N-children last year we even met snoop dogg who was staying at the hotel . 
i visit chicago on visit every six weeks or so . this year i ' ve tended to rotate around between the trump , the conrad and the new hotel palomar , based on price and availability . i had occasion to stay at the conrad twice in september , once at the beginning of the month and then on an award trip overnight third week of the month . i still like the hotel very much--beds are comfy , decor is nice . it ' s a very comfortable place to stay . a few observations early-month trip when i checked in , they had a spread of fruit and water in the room with a card with someone else ' s name on it . obviously , not my room . but , they let me stay and keep the stuff , which was nice . ended up having to work late hours in the room and had occasion to order room service . really excellent food . even the fries were good in a unique way . room service guy was great , very conscientious , though it took way too long . with those tvs , though , they need to update to hd . put on a movie to keep me up while working and the no hd option really reduced the benefit of the N movie . also , when i called about the fact that the lamps in the room would just randomly turn off , the response wasn ' t helpful . i called twice over my N-day trip . never was fixed . on the plus side , the front desk was able to extend my stay at the same rate when i had to stay another day , so that was nice . late-month overnight on the late month stay , i discovered that if you don ' t pay for a room , that have the tiniest room ever just waiting for you . definitely too small by chicago standards . not even room in the bathroom for a separate shower stall . kind of bummed by the fact that on a weekend when the hotel obviously wasn ' t full that i couldn ' t get even a normal room for the zillion points they charged . so , it ' s still among the top options in chicago . service has been up and down , so going to the palomar for my next trip . 
we spent two nights at the amalfi . after reading some of the reviews , i sent an e-mail to the hotel to request a quiet room , facing the front , rather than the back side of the hotel ( where the loading dock and dumpsters are located ) . i received a response very promptly and was told that a room on the fifth floor with view on the city had been blocked for us . the room was extremely nice king-size bed , big windows , very nice soothing decor . the first impression was one of cleanliness . the room smelled good , and everything looked impeccable . the bed was extremely comfortable , the linens of excellent quality , the bath products very nice . little details i should mention nice lamps , nice tv with cd and dvd player ( dvds can be borrowed free of charge at the front desk , and some cds are already in the room ) , in-room coffee maker , nice closet with iron and ironing board and full-length mirror , magnifying mirror in the bathroom with different light settings for make-up , hair dryer , curved shower curtain rod that allows for more room in the tub shower and makes it possible to take a shower without ever being in contact with the shower curtain , certificate showing the room is an allergy friendly room . in addition , the manager ' s reception with great cocktails ( amalfitini and amore for example ) and a buffet with roasted vegetables , tapenade , cheese , foccacia , and a variety of italian cold cuts is a really nice touch after a long arduous day of shopping ! of course , the lounge is small and seating is insufficient ( especially on the weekend ) , but if you plan it right ( arrive there early ! ) , it makes for a very pleasant hour and a half . the breakfast buffet is another nice perk . a buffet is set across from the elevators on each floor coffee , tea , juices , a variety of pastries , croissants , bagels , and fruit are available to take back to your room on a little tray that is provided . very convenient ! all in all , i would highly recommend this hotel friendly associates , quiet and comfortable rooms , convenient location with lots of restaurants in the vicinity ( avoid redfish at all costs . we waited N minutes to be served after we ordered , the food was bad , the service inadequate , and our check --as well as the checks of our neighbors on each side-- was inaccurate . we could not wait to leave ! ) good restaurant choices are brasserie jo for french food and joe ' s seafood prime steak stone crab , among many others . we will definitely consider this hotel next time we go to chicago . 
me and N friends flew into chicago to check out both baseball parks . half of us flew into o ' hare and the other N from midway . all of us had success taking the el downtown and walked N blocks to find hotel allegro . a great safe area we were all pleasantly surprised because we had never been to chicago and we landed late at night . when we spoke to the front desk we knew we were in the right place , " pretty woman " and " pulp fiction " helped us out . each member ' s name tag had their favorite movie under their name . every worker was super friendly in helping us find the right way to our destinations and suggesting ones we never thought of . i can ' t guarantee that you will be so lucky , but we got a killer deal online for N double beds for N a night . plus , we received a card for N free drinks and an appetizer downstairs at the lounge for every night of our stay . location was great , right near the el and walking distance to anything you would need to see in downtown . 
we just spent several hours getting a " quick " bite to eat in the sports bar in this hotel as we were afraid to go outside to find someplace else since this area of the city is not the best and the actual restaurant was not open . first , they gave my salad to my fiance with chicken on top , which i did not order . there was no creamy balsalmic dressing on it so i was waiting for them to bring that , and my fiance ' s salad was still nowhere to be found . instead , they took my salad back and it took another half an hour for the rest of our food to come , including my correct salad . and not including the cup of soup i ordered . my fiance , however , had been given the wrong salad . neither of us were given dressing this time either . so while we waited for that , the bartender went back to find out if my fiance could get the salad he ordered instead of the one he was given . he ended up just eating the wrong salad , and i was so hungry that i ate half of mine before we were even given dressing ( blue cheese and italian neither of which were what was supposed to come with my salad in the first place ) . no soup to be found . we asked for it again . i ended up being pretty hungry once i finished my salad , so while the bartender made up our checks i asked if i just wasn ' t going to have any soup . i was still hungry and about to work until Nam with a half-empty stomach for N hours . as we were leaving , my soup came out and i had to finish it in about N seconds . the worst part was that the bartender was apparently supposed to pay for the kitchen ' s ( frequent and bad ) mistakes . . . she comped my fiance ' s salad and used her tips to pay for it , so we felt bad and gave her the money for his meal anyway . she definitely didn ' t deserve to be treated the way the kitchen was treating her , and after she spent three hours trying to get them to make our food , she shouldn ' t have to pay for it herself . i had been in the car since very early this morning driving to chicago and now i ' m sitting in my room , exhausted and upset instead of enjoying myself like i should be . at least i finally got to eat something . the front desk and bellhop were very helpful just please get ahold of your kitchen . there wasn ' t even anyone else ordering food in the bar . 
from the moment my family and i stepped onto the property we experienced some of the best customer service i have ever experienced . the staff was helpful and prompt in each request we had . the room was wonderful with a beautiful view . the breakfast was full cook to order with anything you could want . we were visiting during spring break and were at the hotel on easter morning . the breakfast area was very busy and i expected a long wait to get an omelete that morning , however i was pleasantly suprised at the quick service i received . during the breakfast time staff were constantly interacting with guests and ensuring that things were stocked and tables were cleared and cleaned . 
no too far from midway . non-descript hotel from the outside , but beautiful on the inside . we loved our room - great beds , fantastic feather pillows . they provided a hypoallergenic pillow to a member of our party who is allegic to feathers . pleasant and fast check-in and check-out . nice workout facility . we really enjoyed our stay and wished it was for more than N night . will definitely stay again . 
i stayed in the knickerbocker for N nights the second week of september . i could not have been more pleased with the location of the hotel in chicago ' s gold coast immediately across from the drake hotel . it ' s in the block next to the john hancock building and a block from some of the most amazing shopping you will ever encounter . the knickerbocker hotel was extremely comfortable ! i had two N inch flat screen tv ' s in my room . the bathroom far exceeded what i ' ve come to expect from a typical hotel . it had a waterfall shower head , glass shower and very modern bathroom fixtures . the king bed was truly restful . i wouldn ' t hesistate to recommend this hotel to my colleagues . when i ' m in chicago i would stay here again . 
clean and well located . staff was friendly . fitness room was excellent for a smallish hotel . i recommend it for business and couples travel . well priced . 
we really loved this hotel . it felt cozy and intimate and subdued . not bold and flashy . the concierge was very help to my husband and get an anniversary present shipped to the hotel without my knowledge . the staff was very friendly , upbeat and warm . the rooms were very nice and just our style . our views from our window were wonderful of the lake and the watertower and the john hancock building . we were on the Nth floor in a grand deluxe king room over looking michigan avenue . the location couldn ' t have been better . we had drinks at the signature room lounge in the john hancock buidling to watch the sunset ( nothing as beautiful as the florida sunsets we have here ) . and the food , service and views from the nomi restaurant were great . i don ' t know why the restaurant doesn ' t get better press . it ' s very romantic and breakfast was gorgious sitting at the windows looking at the lake . 
classy , clean , quiet , comfy bed and near everything . yup , it was a block away from michigan avenue and across the street from the john hancock center . if you want to see the great view on top of the hancock without spending any money , go to the bar and walk around the window . my room was N in the corner ( bad view ) far away from the elevator . it was a one room suite complete with a full freakin ' kitchen . i paid N plus about N in taxes per night in mid oct . N but i was part of a wedding party . i think the regular rate for this room was higher . when i checked out , i left my bags with the concierge to be picked up later in the day . no charge . i remember in ny they charged me for this service and i complained about it . all in all this place is a winner . hollywood howie
we stayed at this hotel last weekend after finding a deal on priceline . com . great location - we were able to walk to so many places . if you don ' t mind a mile or so walk in any direction you can get many places by foot . we had a view of the chicago river from our room . room was kind of small but clean and the view more than made up for it . front desk staff was very friendly and helpful . we didn ' t eat at the restaurants or go to the bars in the hotel but the lobby area was beautiful . one tip - they charge N per day for valet parking . if you ask they will tell you they don ' t have a self park option . however , you can self park your car at surrounding lots . we found one just a block away at N s . wacker . it ' s a little tough to drive to because the entrance is on lower wacker but if you can get there it was N per day . definitely saved us some money . good option if you don ' t want to get your car out of the garage during your stay . 
we stayed here for N nights at the end of august N and were expecting it to be really nice having read the reviews and were not disappointed . it ' s a lovely clean modern hotel . we got a really good rate via expedia so weren t too surprised when we were given a room on the Nth floor overlooking the delivery area of the surrounding buildings , we were woken twice by the beeping of reversing delivery lorries . the room itself was fantastic and we had a view of most of one side of the john hancock building which more than made up for it . the outside bar on the Nth floor was a bit disappointing , pretty expensive and i had to ask the waitress to clean my table , we only had one drink so perhaps we called at a bad time ? i most definitely will stay here again and would have no problem if we were in the same room . 
after reading other reviews i decided to reserve a room at the hotel burnham for my son and his wife ' s first anniversary . i can ' t begin to tell you how very helpful the hotel was in setting everything up ! ! the room they stayed in was gorgeous ! it was a corner room on the historic Nth floor and they were both beyond thrilled with it ! martin jimenez went well out of his way in sending restaurant recommendations and making reservations at the restaurant of my son ' s choice . he made sure everfhing was done exactly to my requests and even left a note for my son and his wife wishing them a happy anniversary since he was not working the night they stayed . they enjoyed drinks in the bar which were " on the house " as a special the hotel was running in december . they reported that the location was central to everything and they could easily walk everywhere , even in the cold winter of chicago ! i just want to say " thank you " again to martin as well as everyone at the hotel . my son and his wife said everyone they encountered was so helpful and friendly and they had a stay they will never forget ! this is where i plan to stay if i make an overnight trip to chicago ! ! ! 
our first experience at a comfort suites hotel was last year in otay mesa ( san diego suburbs ) . despite the very desert area where the hotel was located , our stay was so positively surprising that we decided to book the same hotel chain this year too but in chicago this time . once again our experience exceeded our expectations ! ! we spent N week and were lodged at the Nth floor . well , despite the exterior side of this hotel seen from the street is really nothing special ( much more beautiful the one in otay mesa ) , the apartments are incredibly comfortable very clean and fully equipped ( kitchen , laundry and drier machines , safety box ) . the hotel is located in chicago downtown at N min walk by the beautiful millennium park ! staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful . despite kitchens in the aprtaments , breakfast is included in the price and it s very good and rich . moreover , as the breakfast area is not enough wide to contain many people seated at the same time , guests are allowed to bring food in their apartments which , sometimes , can be helpful especially during crowded hours . all in all i can say that our stay was very pleasant at the comfort suites . 
the essex is in a great location overlooking grant park and the lake and within walking distance to shedd aquarium , field museum etc . not far away either is city center , magnificent mile etc . public transport options are quite close as well . the hotel itself is clean and tidy , albeit not overly attractive . the room was quite small overall however the fittings and furniture were new and quite nice . hotel amenities weren ' t too bad with onsite pool and restaurant . service from staff wasn ' t outstanding but they were polite and willing to help . overall , good value hotel in a good location . 
i recently stayed at the four points and when i arrived i was suprised at how easy it was to find with it being surronded by so many other buildings . when i walked into the lobby i was amazed by the decor and how beautiful it was . but when i went to check in my room was checked out to someone else . but the staff was really good and accomdated our needs so well that i am willing to make this hotel my permanent hotel for all my downtown weekend stays . i am now planning another weekend trip downtown chicago and this time with the family so we can enjoy all the special amenities the hotel has to offer . thank you for making my weekend get away an enjoyable one . great job ! ! ! ! ! 
this is one of the nicest hotels near o ' hare . . . and i ' ve stayed at most of them ! united airlines put me up here for a night after a recent cancellation . . . they usually get me the hilton , but they were booked . i have very little bad to say about this place ! first of all , the room was quite spacious--a little larger than most all-suite properties . the decor was very new and fresh . the parlor room had a flat-panel tv while the bedroom had a standard tube tv . the bathroom was very large and marblesque . i joked with my wife about the shower--i came out and said , " whew , that was close--i almost got lost in there ! " the shower was that big . a few minor gripes with the room the blinds--they were very tough to close . also , while the bed was super-comfy , the pillows were pretty weak . but my biggest gripe was the bed was a queen--not sure if they have kings or not . . . we sleep on a king at home , so to us it seemed cramped . this was a club-level room--i have low-level elite status with marriott , so not sure if the standard rooms are any different . the restauant was amazing ! it was a saturday night shortly before closing--only people in there . service was great , but the food . . . i had their signature pasta dish , which was to die for . next time united strands me at o ' hare , i ' ll request this hotel over the hilton , even though it ' s about N minutes further from ord . 
this hotel was very small and the rooms were painfully small . the bed had to be pushed all the way against one wall and you could barely turn around in the bathroom . but , the location was excellent , there was unlimited , free bottled water , and the rooms were clean . if all you want is a place to sleep in a great location , the price here is right . also , the pizza place downstairs , bella baccino ' s , is my very favorite . it was kind of a nice coincidence that it shared a building with this hotel . 
the westin chicago river north is in a great location , just a Nmin walk to the chicago theatre , the loop el trains and the start of the miracle mile , and about a Nmin walk to millenium park . we stayed in the deluxe river view room on the Nth floor and opted to spend extra for the complimentary continental breakfast buffet at the executive lounge down the hall each morning , which was worth it . there are a variety of bagels and jam spreads , cream cheese , boiled eggs , fresh fruit and berries , cereals , muesli and yogurts , and orange juice , tea and coffee . the staff were friendly and helpful . also available are hor d ' oeuvres between Npm and Npm which was great and complimentary water , soft drinks and fruit are available anytime . the deluxe room includes free wi-fi via an in-room mac computer which was great . most importantly , the room was very clean , as was the bathroom . the " heavenly bed " really is heavenly . the only negative experience we had was a noisy wedding party in the room next door to us . accordingly , i would recommend not staying in a room with a connecting door since it made the noise all the louder . we had this occur two nights in a row and after we raised the issue with the front desk , they handled the situation very professionally by immediately offering us complimentary wine and cheese plate and adding points to our starwood account for the inconvenience . the only other complaint was that the complimentary water that is offered as part of the deluxe room was not delivered two days in a row , even after we rang for it . despite these isolated incidents though , i would recommend a stay at this hotel for its courteous staff , convenient location , cleanliness , heavenly bed and breakfast - all the things that should make a hotel stay-worthy . 
it was our daughters birthday celebration we wanted something special . the renovations were terrible because the service was sooo bad ! the elevators were so slow we waited N minutes to come down to the lobby then just took the steps all the way from the N th floor . then the lounge was closed , okay maybe for the inconvience to their customers they could have a coffee station , no , they still had you sit in a hallway to have your coffee or wine while the jack hammer was going ! the work out room , the tv didn ' ' t match the headsets , so you couldn ' t listen to the tv , then once again they charged us for bottled water instead of giving us one for the inconvences of the whole hotel . bottom line the service , the hotel was terrible . we normally stay at the drake , we know why now ! 
our trip into the city was tough with a few canceled flights . we couldn ' t have been happier to get to the sofitel . check-in was efficient and warm . our suite was ready early , which helped ease our minds . i was starving , so after putting our luggage in the room we went directly to the concierge desk . katie was great ! it was our first time in the city and she carefully explained the city layout and pointed out some great attractions . we decided on pizano ' s for lunch and loved it ! it was a great recommendation . she also made dinner recommendations and seemed to be available day and night , whenever we called the desk ! our room turned out great too . the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was so large and luxurious ! overall , the staff seemed to be on point at all times . valet was quick , le bar was really relaxing , but fun too ! we will definitely look forward to staying at sofitel again ! 
i ' m writing this review from the hotel . i ' m here for a conference that is taking place at the allerton and a block of rooms were set aside . i stayed here N years ago or so and it was very old and needed to be updated . when i saw that the conference would be here my first thought was " are they kidding ? " but i checked out the allerton website and saw that the entire place had been completely redesigned . i still wasn ' t N sure but they had pictures of the outside as well so i thought i ' d give it a try . i ' m really glad i did . the hotel has a boutique hotel feel without the snotty attitude that one finds at other hotels in the genre . it is very clean , all new lobby , bar , restaurant and rooms . the rooms are still small ( as they were before ) - which is fine with me - but the beds are comfortable and the bath roomy . all of the staff - and i really mean all - is very friendly and helpful . they have gone out of their way to make sure i am comfortable , have heated milk for my coffee and helped with reservations . the food is great too ! highly recommend it ! 
we stayed two nights at the renaissance last week . we had stayed here several years ago and had security issues at that time . this time , on the morning of check-out , i happened to notice a small corner of a piece of paper that was N Nths outside in the hall . it was our bill , not in an envelope , with our name , address , charges and credit card used all out there for any passer-by to see . the room itself was okay though the toilet was rather sluggish . the bathrobe provided looked like it was ready for the rag bag . there were plenty of clean towels provided and the bed was comfortable . next time we ' ll stick to the swiss or the talbot . 
stayed in N recently . paid extra for the lake view . yes , you can see the lake but it is partially blocked by some buildings . this was a nice hotel and cleaner nicer than most i ' ve stayed in . the staff was great too . i have no complaints ! 
as a former customer service trainer , i ' m always observing customer experiences . the downtown chicago red roof definitely earns an a ! since i started my current job a year ago , i ' m back and forth to chicago often . we stay at the downtown red roof for the value and the proximity to our office . the staff has always been extremely friendly and accommodating , and they always knew my boss by name , which was nice , but expected seeing that she stays there sometimes N weeks out if a month or more . the rooms are always clean , the beds always comfy . it was my last visit which blew me away . i had not been to chicago for probably N months . even when i came regularly , unlike my boss , i was only there maybe once a month . when i checked in , i wasn ' t surprised that they greeted me as if they were really happy to see me . i wasn ' t even surprised that despite the hundreds and hundreds of people who are in and out of the busy hotel , they recognized my face . what shocked me was as i reached in my purse to get my id , the clerk addressed me by name . she knew what kind of room i liked . she even knew to use my redi card and corporate code to get me the best rate . . . all without me saying a word . i felt like a celebrity . in addition to the five-star customer service , the hotel provides the most affordable and covenient valet parking in downtown chicago . they offer free bag checking for those who arrive before check-in or business travellers like me who need a place to stash their luggage after check-out while they conduct their business in the city . there are great restaurants just steps away , and the hotel is just a block from the magnificent mile . when i ' m at the red roof in downtown chicago , i feel like i ' m in a home away from home . 
let me first say that i was not looking forward to staying at this hotel . initially i wanted a place closer to downtown , but since my conference was at mccormick place i had little choice . second , i generally despise conference hotels since thay are impersonal and just too big for the personal touches and attention . what a suprise to find that the hyatt at mccormick place defied my expectations . first and foremost , the service was great . the staff , to a person , was pleasant , helpful and often went beyond the call of duty . i was able to get an upgrade to a suite and a late check-out for example . by the way , the suite which was on the Nnd floor was wonderful and had a phenomenal view of lake michigan and downtown . the only downside , as may people have commented in their reviews , is that the hotel is out of the way , and you end up paying a small fortune in cab fares to get around town . that being said , if you are on conference at mccormick place , this is the place to be . 
the best part of this hotel is the view . it sits on top of the chicago sun times building , with the huge lobby on the Nth floor . our room was on the Nrd floor overlooking the chicago river everything on it breathtaking ! i feel bad for the reviewer who said she had a view of a wall that would be awful ! the beautiful merchandise mart was next door by way of a pedestian walkway , as was the train station , which was so convenient for us ! the room was lovely clean with comfy beds ( most important ! ) we were also able to take advantage of the view from the cityscape bar on the lobby level , complete with free appetizers ! my only complaint would be the very expensive breakfast menu in the hotel ' s restaurant ( N for french toast ( ! ) N . N for a cup of coffee ) i believe it was the same as the room service menu in the room . 
friendly check in , no waiting although obviously will be busy at times . rooms immaculate and fabulously comforable beds . very quiet , at least where i was staying , heard nothing at all in N nights . superb situation with grant park opposite and buddy guys right next door . blackies for breakfast or just a drink for local flavour and easy walking to field museum . taxis outside all day and evening and not expensive to get to the mag mile or navy pier for a night out . a must for a romantic evening is a dinner cruise from navy pier . buddy guys for blues lovers , busy and crowded but brilliant . dont take notice of the doom merchants , stay at the hilton . 
we stayed at the sheraton chicago for four nights and loved the location . our room faced the river and had views of the lake . my boys ( N and N ) enjoyed looking out the window at the big city life , river taxis , and skyscrapers . the hotel was an easy walk to michigan avenue and navy pier . the indoor swimming pool needs updating , but the boys loved it . the staff ( especially concierge ) was very helpful . the lobby has neat computer games that kept the kids entertained . we would definitely stay there again . 
after christmas me and my sister got a surprise trip to chicago at the fairmont it was fabulous ! ! ! our room was almost at the the top floor and we got a beautiful view of the park below and it is conveniently a N minute walk to a deep dish pizza parlor . 
this was a great little hotel for access to soldier field and the museums . it is a relatively short walk to them and to grant park . the service was good and the rooms large . it is an old mansion that could use a little updating . we had a king suite in the front of the house . for the size of the room , the location , and the city of chicago the charges were appropriate . i was concerned about walking to soldier field and back at night but those worries were dispelled when limos and taxi were dropping off concert goers in front of our hotel and there was a strong police presence . obviously i felt safe that night . there was a solid breakfast in the morning . all in all it was a nice and comfortable place in a great location for the concert and at a decent price . 
this first class hotel commanding stunning architectural views over the city and lake was a perfect , relaxing place to stay and made our visit to chicago . conveniently located just a step-away from the busy city hubbub and situated beside the waterway within a short walking distance of shops , galleries , museums , etc . friendly staff at every level and a very comfortable , well-appointed room with coffee always available . we chose a tariff to include breakfast and would highly recommend this option which also included delicious complimentary evening hors d ' oeuvres , what a bonus ! excellent hotel and value . 
stayed here for N nights mainly for work on my first trip to chicago . room had everything i needed , comfortable bed , fridge , good desk space and sofa area . but no safe box . i had a room on N floor facing east . the view was good but not spectacular . there is a fire station a block away and the sirens from the fire trucks were slightly annoying . the free wireless was pretty slow and the free breakfast food itself was mediocre but i liked the relaxed style - you could come and go as you please , take the food back to your room and they kept the coffee bar open all day . service was good . front desk staff were helpful and there was a very pleasant waitress in the breakfast room . the only thing that would keep me away is the other guests that stayed here . call me snobby but i found there were too many noisy families with lots of young kids running around . 
i live in chicago and stayed here for a bachelorette party . it has a fantastic location because it is by so many restaurants , bars , etc . one major problem is that when the reservation was made , we requested a cot . it wasn ' t in the room so we called down to the front desk and the said that it wasn ' t noted on the reservation and that we couldn ' t have one . at that time we asked if we could get some extra pillows and blankets and we were told that if we wanted those that we ' d have to come down and get our own . if i ' m paying well over N for a hotel room for one night i better be getting that kind of thing brought to me . 
this is a typical w hotel , which , for us , made it a lot of fun . it ' s got a great , hip lobby with lots of stuff going on all the time . they have a good restaurant , and it is right within walking distance of lake michigan and navy pier . the mag . mile isn ' t too far ( several blocks ) , so it is a little trek . . . but if you ' re young and don ' t mind walking a lot , then it is doable . the rooms are fantastic . the beds , as always are wonderful . the view was good , as well . overall , if you can find it at a good deal , i ' d recommend it . it was a little pricy though . 
my fiance and i stayed at the allerton for a long weekend to take in the sites of chicago as well as attend the bears game on N N N . it was our first visit to chicago and the central location the mag mile was perfect- walking distance to everything ! pros safe , central location walkable to everything , clean rooms , yummy breakfast , great fitness center , raul -waiter during breakfast was great , bellhops very cordial , o ' hare travel board with arrivals and departures right in lobby . cons ambulances , police cars going to northwestern trauma center around the corner with siren at all hours of the night is tough on light sleepers , check-in staff was somewhat lethargic and not exactly eager to please , bar lounge was sometimes not staffed and did not offer as great of scene as adjacent hotels . despite the cons , i would visit again , as it was well priced and convenient . 
we have stayed at the essex three times , all as an overnighter before catching the train . on this particular trip we wanted a room that faced navy pier so we could watch the fireworks from our room . the desk clerk worked with us until we found just the ' right ' room . we were given an amazing room with the perfect view . the clerk was so helpful and friendly , we felt quite pampered . the location is fantastic . we have had queen , king and suite type rooms and all have been clean and comfortable . folks who don ' t like the essex most likely don ' t like old nostalgic hotels . this one evokes an old chicago feel with modern day comfort . perfect for the middle-aged who appreciate good service , good value and don ' t need a lot of modern-day frills . 
very good hotel for short stays . the room ( two double beds ) is not big , but well arranged . the staff is very nice and helpful . the hotel is one block from michigan ave ( magnificent mile ) , just south of northwestern law and medical school . restaurants and boutiques nearby , N or N min walk to navy pier , millenium park , about Nmin walk for the loop . nice walking area . free wifi . 
the homewood suites were a perfect central spot for exploring all the chicago highlights . we were close by to shopping , the theatre , and plenty of good restaurants . trader joe ' s was just around the corner so we picked up some bottled water , wine and fruit on the first day . the free trolley was a great option to get to attractions and tours near the pier . the only thing i would not recommend around the hotel is the espn zone bar restaurant . the free daily breakfast was convenient and had plenty of options . the free wireless in rooms and business center were also nice . our room was very large , but could have used some updating . we would not hesitate to stay here again on a future trip . 
this hotel is in a great location downtown and , from what i can tell , a good bargain . ( i had a convention rate of N night . ) i can personally recommend the housekeeping staff -- i left a drawerful of stuff behind , by accident , and a staffperson cheerfully arranged to have it shipped promptly to my home , no charge . a big bonus - there ' s a trader joe ' s grocery store in the ground floor of the hotel , a great place to pick up snacks and drinks . ( my room came equipped with a fridge and microwave if i hadn ' t been there for a conference , i could ' ve eaten very cheaply and relatively healthfully if needed . ) the staff members that handled our conference meals and gatherings were attentive and professional . only small negative , the downstairs lobby is small and tends to be crowded and noisy . ( i was able to check in quickly , though . ) also , the elevators are slow my advice if you ' re fit , get a low floor and find the stairs . they ' re carpeted , and accessible with a key card , so i felt safe . the restaurant downstairs , eleaven , was good and inexpensive - great bagels . 
the hotel has a very cool lobby , and the staff is great- very helpful and responsive . it has the usual kimpton happy hour , which is always a hit with guests . our room , however , was tiny and loud . as i have stated in other reviews , i am sensitive to noise issues at hotels- the walls at this hotel were paper thin , to the point where a person could hear drawers closing and hangers being hung . also , there was no way to escape hall noise . thank goodness our neighbors in the rooms were not loud guests . i would not go out of my way to stay here again . 
after reviewing several hotels my friend and i decided to book through priceline - big mistake ! we drew the short stick and wound up with hotel felix . we were taking a last minute girl ' s trip to chicago for a long weekend . i knew felix was a boutique hotel - no big deal , just needed two beds . i contacted denise -- ( head of reservations ) weeks in advance and she was not only rude , but the least bit helpful . we were crammed in the worst room with one queen bed on a floor with a view of neighboring parking lot . the only positive was that the bed was very comfortable , then again i was sharing it with my friend so it wasn ' t even worth enjoying ! if hotels do not wish to accommodate customers who book through third party sites , they should not list their extra rooms through partners like priceline , orbitz , expedia . . . . i will do my very best to avoid this hotel and the inconsiderate staff in the future . be warned ! 
i know i ' m going to enjoy my stay at a hotel when the staff at the check in desk is friendly enough to joke around with you . we booked a king deluxe room that has an extra sitting area . the price was very reasonable ( N a night , booked right before we got there ) since we were there for the rsna conference and every other hotel jacks up their prices to be N ( best western ) to N ( hilton ) . i wasn ' t willing to pay that much for a regular hotel that required paid valet parking and i would still have to drive or take a shuttle to get to the mccormick center . if you aren ' t traveling alone , the walk from the hotel to the center was very short and safe enough . as a girl , i would not walk it alone at night but would still feel completely comfortable with walking it in the day . it only took us N minutes to walk to the west part of the center . the doors are open even though it was not in use during the conference so it was not hard to get to the lakeside center . i was also able to park my car right in the courtyard of the hotel which was fully gated and required a key card to get in . i could even see my car from our room window . the first thing i noticed when i walked into the room was the layout . i didn ' t think having an extra seating area would be anything special for the extra N a night but i liked it ! it was large enough for us to sit there and eat comfortably while keeping it separate from our sleeping area . the room had a large mini fridge and a coffee maker . it did not have a microwave but the staff at the front desk was absolutely wonderful and microwaved our left overs for us . we went to joy yee restaurant in chinatown our first night and had soo many leftovers . the food was great and cheap . chinatown is very close and i did not sense any bad neighborhood vibes from it like other reviewers mentioned . if you ' re aware and careful , any area is safe . i ' ve yet to be robbed once or had a problem my entire life and i ' ve traveled all over the world ( knock on wood ) . the bed was a regular king size bed which was satisfactory . the tv was flat screen and wonderful for my boyfriend ( espn . . . ) the bathroom was large and the shower curtain rod is rounded so it makes the large tub even bigger . the shower curtain was a bit short though for when you ' re taking a shower and you put the curtain inside . i did have to go buy bar soap because the one there contained aloe and i ' m allergic to it . what i wasn ' t expecting the most was the cleaning service . they came early ( N N ) but since we were there for the conference , it wasn ' t a problem . they go away if you lock it and don ' t open the door too . but what i was surprised about was how clean they made everything ! the lady even put a face towel under our items on the bathroom counter top . she threw away our empty drinks on the sitting area table too . the linens were always nice and hair free . the lobby area of the hotel was very modern but also very comfortable to sit around it . they had lots of couches and tables . people were always there working away on their laptops or sitting around reading books . even with people there all the time , there was also always enough seating that you could find a space . i don ' t know how much more i can praise this place but if i ' m coming to chicago for the conference again next year , i ' ll definitely be back . 
i have stayed at the burnham a few years ago and while originally i was happy to be back , i think the service is slipping--or certainly was not great when i was there . i booked a room at the burnham as the palomar ( in which i have stayed in twice this spring ) was full . the location is still good for tourists . the hotel is located in the loop area blocks from millennium park and the geary stage , near the art institute , and close to all the major museums and aquarium . nordstrom rack next door , and starbucks a few doors down . the hotel is a great historic building and so the room sizes vary . i paid and signed up for a kimpton upgrade online . i was told it was granted ( via email ) but surprisingly when i checked in at N N pm , the room i was given was smaller than the rooms i typically have occupied at this hotel . it was the smallest double i have ever seen ! ! it certainly was not an upgrade and when i mentioned it to the front desk that it was a low floor , no view , and really tiny , they said it was all they had . i found out later that it wasn ' t the case and another employee admitted it wasn ' t an upgrade and the hotel wasn ' t full . i don ' t know if i was given such a dinky room since i checked in so late in the day , but i had business meetings since my arrival on a N N am flight that morning and didn ' t have time to come to the hotel earlier . i had to remind the staff that i was a kimpton in touch member and ask for the coupon that usually is handed to a member on arrival . they tried to tell me i wasn ' t an in touch member ( which i found funny since i had stayed in a kimpton hotel twice in may--chicago and dc ) but they finally located the envelope addressed to me with the coupon . they didn ' t apologize . i spent the evening outside the hotel at a private party and then dinner--at rl which is one of my all time favorites . when we returned , i wanted to go have drinks with my sister and found out that the hotel restaurant and bar closes at N pm . since it wasn ' t busy , apparently they were closing at N N pm instead--it seemed rather early for a friday night . --and couldn ' t give us a glass of wine to take to our rooms . so i asked the front desk for a recommendation but they said they didn ' t know anything in the area that was open . so i asked about room service--thinking we would order a bottle of wine . the person at the desk said his colleague ( who was standing next to him ) handles room service and referred me to him . problem was that the colleague was on a personal phone call right at the desk ! i literally waited over N minutes listening to him talk to his friends loudly and finally just gave up and went upstairs . i was only there N night ( flew in for business , checked in at N N pm , immediately left the hotel for dinner and returned at N N pm and then checked out the next morning and went to o ' hare ) so it didn ' t really matter but i will not be staying at this kimpton in chicago again . i admit i am disappointed as i used to love this hotel and raved about it to friends , but the service seems to have fallen . don ' t get me wrong , the hotel is adequate but merely average . i stay in kimpton hotels around the country and their standard is so high , that the average stands out as below the bar . next time i will be staying at the chicago palomar whose service is up to the usual fantastic kimpton standard . 
my wife and i traveled with our three elementary-school-aged children for spring break . we ended up at the palomar because of the excellent " grand opening " rates which allowed us to book a suite rather than two separate rooms . simply put we had a wonderful stay . from the bellman to the room service waiter , every member of the staff was exceedingly kind , courteous , and worked hard to please . chic " boutique hotels " can be a bit intimidating for families , especially those with small children , but everyone made us feel like we were the " coolest " of their " cool " guests . the suite room was spotless , hip-ly furnished , and huge . the similarly ample bath with marble shower and jetted soaking tub was fantastic . we ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant , and again , the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating , especially our waiter . the food was excellent . we ate other meals out , as the hotel is located in the middle of some of the best restaurant territory in chicago . there were some " grand opening " glitches , that really do not merit mention . the fire extinguishers were still wore their the construction dust covers . construction dust and dirt bubbled up in the soaking tub ( at least i hope it was construction dust ! ) room service brought meals without any silverware . there were no pillows or blankets for the kids ' pull-out bed . all of these problems were quickly and efficiently remedied with a call to the reception desk . all in all , we will definitely consider returning to the palomar at our next opportunity . 
even if we didn ' t have a terrible experience with the front desk about the inadequacy of our first room , i would have to comment on how the hotel has deteriated since our stay just a year ago . the staff is still extremely cordial ( except for our checking in experience ) , but our room was in terrible shape . the sliding closet doors would absolutely not move . one was open so we had access to the hangers but could not use the safe which was behind the closed part . the magnifying mirror in the bathroom was on a loose bracket and could not be used because it hung so low , not to mention that the light on it did not work . the chair at the desk had upholstery so worn that the stuffing was coming through . it looked like it should be on the sidewalk for garbage pickup . this is very sad because we were looking forward to our return after a wonderful stay last year . 
loved this place ! ! it is a very convenient train ride from midway airport , and only a block or two away from the randolph station . we arrived at noon , and even though checkin wasn ' t until N we got our two rooms immediately , which was really nice . my room faced the river and had a huge cushioned window seat ( easily the size of a single bed ) . the king sized bed was very comfortable , and the bedding really nice . turndown service each night is a great little extra . we had not expected to come back to a filled ice bucket and chocolates on the pillow . the toiletries are very nice , and we appreciated having an umbrella left in the room . my brother had a " tall " room which he liked ( longer bed taller shower ) , but his view was of the roof and his ice bucket wasn ' t filled one night . we had the bellhop hold our bags since we weren ' t leaving town until well after checkout . we had no problems with this either . you are in easy walking distance to macy ' s , nordstrom rack , goldcoast dogs , the cta , a number of bus stops , and just a few blocks from tons of other stores and restaurants . we noticed many people with their dogs , but did not hear any barking in our room . we would definitely stay here again . 
stayed at the sofitel for N night . the location is perfect blocks away from the magnificent mile ( michigan ave . ) . if your there just for a few days then use public transportation . the hotel is only a few blocks from the red line and from most buses . the staff was extremely helpful and friendly . the concierge was full of useful information . the room was beautiful . we had a king room on the Nth floor . once i laid down on the feather bed i didn ' t want to get back up . it was almost sinful how comfortable it was . the down in the featherbed is treated to be allergen free . my wife who is allergic to down had no problems . the room was decorated very nicely . pictures on the walls , there was a chaise to lounge on . we ordered room service sunday morning . the food came within N minutes . the food was hot and very good . the sofitel is now my favorite hotel in chicago . 
i got stuck with this hotel using priceline . this place is nowhere near the star ratings i ' ve seen it at . the place was dingy , dirty , and smelly . the bed was horribly uncomfortable , and the desk staff was rude and unpleasant . their valet would park your car for you but you can save some by parking it yourself a block or so north at the garage attached to the four seasons . i would never stay here again and would most certainly not recommend it to anyone else . 
they charge your credit card at the time of booking not at time of arrival . do not do this ! this is a scam-ish deal . they will not refund if something goes wrong . . . . . . also they turned off heating system . no heater ! ! ! ! temps out were Nish . . . no fun cold room and very hard bed . 
this hotel is perfect . it ' s location is just right for a weekend trip to chicago as it ' s close to the downtown loop area but also close to lincoln park , the navy pier , and the lake . it ' s within blocks of the hancock building and michigan avenue but not in the super touristy water tower place . the hotel itself is beautiful . . . new but with lots of character and interesting touches . it ' s a modern boutique style but softer and , i think , better done than a w . the room was large and extremely comfortable with great touches and a super comfy bed . the staff was extremely gracious and upgraded us to a suite when our room wasn ' t ready upon our arrival ( we were a bit early , around N ) . and , everyone we encountered on the staff was upbeat and helpful . we would definitely return to this hotel and highly recommend it . 
great location on michigan avenue , yet old and tired . heat in room is so loud , hard to sleep . needs a shot in the arm . the staff is good though ! 
the design of the hotel makes for some noise issues but overall it ' s a pleasant experience . the front desk staff , clem in particular are very helpful , polite and professional . clem went out of her way to provide information and to help ensure that our needs were met . people are very eager to write negative reviews but i wanted to take the time to compliment clem on being a superior customer service represenative . the free morning breakfast is much better then expected offering a vast assortment of choices . i have had some bad complimentary breakfasts but this one was very good . located within walking distance of navy pier , shopping and restaurants , the lakefront embassy is a good choice for your chicago stay and with the addition of clem it becomes a great choice . 
my stay at the conrad was wonderful . this hotel is so beautifully decorated and my room was very luxurious . one of the very best parts of my stay was the central location of the conrad to almost everything of interest in chicago . i was able to walk to millinium park , the art institute , all the shops south on michigan avenue and i was able to walk north to oak street , the historical water tower and more great shops along the way . another very important observation was that the staff is so friendly and accomodating . makes an out of towner feel very welcome
the hotel was in a fabulous location and the staff was nice and remembered all the things i had requested before check-in . i can ' t wait to go back to this hotel . 
our experience at the allegro was overall excellent ! my sister was married there and we stayed there . we were treated like kings and queens by the staff . anything we needed they accomodated . the hotel was immaculate , tasteful and fun ! very warm and inviting no matter where you are from . N great bars and a restaraunt . great place for special events . the regular rooms are a bit small , but nice . the suites are beautiful ! highly reccomended ! ask for carlo if you are planning an event ! ! 
i would not have even bothered writing a review about this hotel if were not for the fact that they ran out of cribs . i expressly stated when i made our reservation that we needed a crib for our infant toddler . when we arrived we were told that they ran out . i asked why . the front desk said that a family extended their stay and needed to keep the one they were using and the hotel did not have any extras . i then asked why , when it became clear that your guests were staying an extra night , you didn ' t make provisions to get more cribs since you knew we were coming . ( i mean , come on , did they think we were not going to notice ? ) after a very long song and dance , where i was made to feel like i was making a fuss , the front desk got someone to go and buy a portable crib from a nearby shop . fortunately , even though it was a holiday weekend , they managed to do this . after this experience , i am not sure i would stay here again . ( there was also hardened dried snot embedded into one of the bedsheets . clearly , the laundering facilities leave something to be desired as well . ) that said , it is right next to the arts institute - which is a major plus if that is the main thing you are doing . 
i had returned to my room one evening and the room was hot . adjusting the thermostat did no good . a hotel engineer happened to be on the floor so i asked if he could look at it . he reset the thermostat and sensor and indicated that if it did not cool down to call again in N minutes . unfortunately , it did not cool down so i called downstairs and another engineer was at my door in minutes . i explained to him what had happened and he asked me to hold tight and he would be back in N minutes . he was back in N minutes with a new ac on a trolley . he slipped the old unit out , put the new one in and the room was now cooling . this took no more than N minutes of his time and i was back to being comfortable . having had this issue before i have run into enginners spending an hour trying to fix the unit or having to move to another room . not here . this is the way these issues should be resolved . my kudos to the engineering staff of the w . these are the small things that tell customers how important they are . 
we spent two nights at this awesome hotel in february N for our visit to the oprah show . everything was perfect ! pros price- N for weeknight with aaa location-one block from redline and a few blocks from michigan ave , starbucks and N-N ( with wine , beer , liquor ! ) a block away , attached to an italian restaurant and ruth ' s chris ( happy hour food for N from N-N ) , many bars and restaurants within two blocks . rockit bar grill was very good and reasonably priced ( N-N entrees , N-N drinks ) . clean friendly staff breakfast was awesome ! waffles , eggs , sausage , cereals , fruits , yogurt . very good selection open N-N . very comfortable beds pool hot tub but we didn ' t use cons ( neither are that bad , but just to make you aware ) valet parking was N . there is a garage next door which ranged from N-N but we didn ' t really check it out . noisy-duh ! ! right next to a fire station but they provide ear plugs . this why i rated sleep quality a N . i am planning on back in the spring when there is not N inches of snow on the ground ! ! ! 
hotel is located well in chicago , in walking distance to many popular sites and attractions , such as navy pier , magnificent mile , and hancock building ( longer walk ) . hotel amenities are ok , certainly the hot breakfast ( but expect lines ) , and attractive suites , but there isn ' t an in-room safe or free web access . some lamps failed to work in the suite , and batteries for tv remotes need replacement . bedrooms are maintained nicely by the housekeeping staff . i liked our view to the south , and you could also see lake michigan . easy access to lobby and street with efficient elevators . device in lobby that allows you to print boarding passes for flights was not providing that feature . also , pool was closed for a whole day unexpectedly . breakfast food good , especially the quickly but well prepared omelettes . bacon was delicious and plentiful . free cocktails and soft drinks in early evening is a nice thing , but it ' s very impersonal . don ' t expect a cocktail party , as many guests pick up drinks and bring them up to suites . if the price is right , then you should consider staying here . 
my stay at the drake was wonderful from start to finish . staff went out of their way to accommodate me from changing rooms to sending someone up to help me figure out the tv remote . i arrived on prom night and the lobby was full of highschool students ready for a night of partying . i was afraid the noise may be heard in the guest rooms but i didn ' t hear a thing all night . the bed was so comfortable too . when my stay ended , i had a great send off when the door man was so pleasant and hailed a taxi for me . 
chicago the chicago marriott hotel magnificent mile , okay but had some serious problems . january Nst N reviewer trip advisor member i had a reservation at the chicago marriott magnificent mile checking in on january N-N N . upon check-in the young lady was wonderful . she noticed in my reservation that i ' d request a complimentary upgrade if it was available . there was availability for an upgrade and i was very happy . this was a treat to myself for new years staying on the magnificent mile in chicago ) . my sister and i checked into the room which had a wonderful view of the city . however i was a little disappointed with the room considering i had just stayed at the marriott atlanta airport on new years eve and the room was simply beautiful and they had just been renovated as well . my sister and i decided to go to the bar for drinks . yes , it was crowded busy . we stood at the bar for N minutes while the bartender totally ignored us . we were standing behind N empty bar stools and watched the bartender take orders from the guest on both sides of us . ( left right side ) we watched the bartender go to the other side of the bar to wait on another guest and we were there first . finally , N men who were also guest at the hotel came over to us and said we ' ve been watching you ladies stand here asking for his attention and the bartender continued to ignore you . one of the men had to literally get the bartender attention and said to him these ladies have been standing here waiting to buy a drink for atleast N minutes or so . yes , that ' s when the bartender came over to serve us and yes he saw us standing there trying to get his attention before the nice men came forward . i was very embarrassed because i ' m also bragging about how nice marriott treats it guest and especially their elite members as compared to hilton . i tried to speak to someone about my concerns but there was only one person at the concierge desk and he had long line and the young lady who checked us in was only the young lady working checking people into the hotel , her line was long . there was N or N empty positions with nobody working standing there to assist the guest . if they were working they didn ' t come out to help the young lady . i have stayed at several full service marriott hotels and i have never seen only one or two people working when it ' s extremely busy especially during the holiday season . if there ' s more than three people in line at a full service marriott you will definitely see another representative come out of the office to help out . therefore i just gave up . i wanted to stay there for new years eve and i ' m glad that i didnt . the rooms are over priced for it ' s decor . and i am talking about the concierge floor room . the hotel was suppose to have been renovated . perhaps they need to visit other marriott hotels to get some ideas . i would have been very upset with myself if i had moved forward with my plans to stay at this hotel for new years eve only to be disappointed with my room and the awful customer service that my sister and i recieved . i am not going to discuss the service during breakfast in the resturant upstairs . the food was great the service was awful . this was very embarrassing and especially being a platinum member with marriott . i ' ve been an elite member for N or N years and this is truly a disappointment . this was my first time ever staying at this hotel and was looking forward to staying there . on the internet the rooms looked great and just being on the magnificent mile in chicago i really expected everything to be on point and it wasn ' t . i only stayed one night and checked out of the hotel . 
stayed here for a conference october N-N , N . we had a group rate of N but found out the room really went for N ! we flew in at N N am and the hotel let us check in early at N - we were exhausted so this was welcome . we upgraded to a window room - room N . this is a fabulous room with great views of the chicago river , navy pier and lake michigan . hotel is in a great location - we walked to restraunts , museums , parks etc . . . the mag mile is very close as well . the bed , as noted in earlier posts , is not what i would expect from a hotel as nice as this . but it was still comfortable . the staff have impeccable manners ! i think this is what you pay for - parking is N day , the gym is N day , the restraunt is very pricey etc . . . but the staff treat you like royalty . one very simple , but very appreciated touch was the water service in the front lobby . it was ice cold and filled with citrus - very refreshing after walking the city , even on cold days . 
we stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers while taking my son and daughter back to school . a week prior we stayed at the w in chicago on lakeshore drive . while both are fine starwood properties , the w was loud and pretentious . the sheraton , on the other hand , impresses in its understatement . it is simply a classic hotel , well appointed , and comfortable . staff was helpful and friendly across the board , from the front desk to the cocktail waitress who brought us our well made drinks . this is my hotel of choice in chicago . 
be careful when booking your room through orbitz or another Nrd party . you can miss the fine print . the hotel can put you in any room they want , smoking or non-smoking , regardless of what you request . one step onto the Nth floor at the whitehall and you will smell what that can mean . the hotel should be ashamed to rent rooms with such a horrible stench , in the curtains , linens , carpet , everywhere . you and your clothes smell of smoke when you leave . basically , you have no choice and the staff is less than professional in they way they handle the issue . 
i have stayed here many times since my mother lives nearby and have experienced all of the things mentioned in other reviews worn furniture and rugs , holes in blankets , surly staff , indifferent cleaning , stuff that didn ' t work , noisy neighbors in moments of passion . but on this last visit i have to say things have improved . the bed was comfortable , the room was clean and looked like it had recently been renovated , the shower was great . it was very hot and muggy in chicago and the air conditioner worked great . there were plenty of towels and the internet was fast . the building is still showing its age but they are making an effort . the lady at the front desk was very friendly and helpful . it is still a great price and it is still the only hotel close to the university of chicago . taxis at the door and close to mass transit--train and bus--to downtown or mccormick place . it is certainly no luxury hotel but the rates are reasonable and it really isn ' t bad . i did not try the restaurant this time . the exercise room is rudimentary . 
we stayed at the amalfi hotel july of N . the check in was very smooth and quick . the room was large with lots of windows , however there was no view , we were on the Nrd floor , with a building right outside our window . the bed was very comfortable , pillow top mattress , feather pillows , and nice quality triple sheeting . the reception hour was wonderful . we had a great bartender and the appetizers were nice . the room was small , with not much seating , but other than that , all was more than acceptable . the location for us was perfect . we took advantage of the free trolley , which runs memorial day to labor day . 
stayed here N-N october for business . i couldn ' t help but notice that some of the " basic " rooms were much smaller than others . same for the bathrooms . the room i had was small but i had a king size bed . not much room for more than N people and i think even that would be tight . the hotel is old but they have put in an effort to keep it updated with the furnishings . the rooms are clean the entire hotel is clean . staff are friendly . it is a huge hotel and there were a lot of people . it is located in a nice part of the city and it is close to a lot of great shopping . i never needed to take a cab to the magnificent mile ( about N minutes to walk ) , and you are close to the macy s , jc penny , etc along state street . overall , a very good experience and i would definitely return . 
our room was quite nice and well equiped with amenities . the staff in the hotel were super nice and the concierge was great ! the location of the hotel was about N blocks off michigan ave . so it was a little less congested there and quieter . we walked every where the city was fantastic and all the venues from museums , restaurants , tours were the best ! we would definately go to chicago again and stay at the talbott . 
upon check in we were informed that " self parking " had no in-out privileges and was N . N per day . the valet option did have in-out privileges , so we chose that option , but it cost N . N per day . a total of N . N to park our car for two days at the hotel . the valet doesn ' t even bring the car to the front door , you have to go down to the basement to pick up your car . the parking charge was N N the cost of our room which we were not happy about , nor do they tell you that when you book your room . secondly , being the weekend before valentine ' s , my husband thought it would be a special surprise to have flowers in our room . he called the hotel a few days before our arrival and spoke to the concierge who assured him they could take care of that . he was referred to randolph florist , who also said , they do that all the time . well upon our arrival , no flowers in the room , spoiling the surprise my husband had planned . the hotel did have the flowers , they offered no apologies or explanation as to what happened with the flower delivery . thirdly , the hotel offers free wi-fi in the rooms , but we had difficulty on my laptop of getting a signal strong enough to use the wi-fi . we sure were disappointed and upon expressing our disappointment were referred by the concierge to log our feedback on tripadvisor . com . fourthly , we were attending the auto show and the hotel advertised a free shuttle to the convention center . the hours of the shuttle were Nam - Nam and then from N Npm - Npm . these times were not advertised anywhere on the hotel web site , only that there was a free shuttle . some other travelers waited over N minutes for the shuttle , that was supposed to run every N N hour . the hotel was convenient to . various locations within walking distance for food , etc . . . . but a return trip back to chicago will result to in us staying in a different hotel . 
i was so disappointed by my N-night visit . it felt neither as a four seasons nor a ritz-carlton ( with the exception of their wonderful staff and the good breakfast ) . the room was old and sparsely furnished . the bathroom among the smallest i have ever seen . the tub ( no separate showe ) was literally attached to the toile-- you had no option of a hand held shower either . at bed turndown the staff did the bare essentials , -- no water , no chocolate , no rug and slippers , no shutting of curtains . no international tv channels , not even cnn international . 
killer location . walkable to just about everywhere . terrific views . excellent fitness center . everything that i ' d expect from sheraton ' s premiere chicago location . 
i have stayed at the talbott a number of times , mostly for business and sometimes for pleasure . it is just beautiful , the rooms feel like a luxurious version of home and the staff could not be more pleasant . all that , and you are in walking distance of so much to do in chicago . . . the talbott really has it all ! 
i stayed at the westin on michigan avenue with my parents when visiting chicago in N . it is a fantastic hotel , with modern decor and absolute high class service ! from the moment you enter the lobby you immediately feel the westin touch . the front desk agents were competent and professional and i will never forget the impact the doorman had on our stay ! he was always smiling and seemed to absolutely love his job . . . the westin on michigan ave . is a must stay for anyone who s visiting chicago ! it is centrally located , and offers great value for N-star service ! 
this is a great location near the magnificent mile in chicago , and the hotel was recently renovated , so the rooms are high quality and very clean looking . there is a nice breakfast on the second floor , staff is attentive to needs , etc . we would definitely stay here again . i was really happy with being allowed to check into the suite early am , due to having a suite available , and the overall value of this property . no complaints at all . 
it was a beautiful hotel with great service however , better suited for business or adult only trips . the hotel was very expensive and in addition to the nightly stay we had to pay N for parking . we rented a movie one evening which cost N - i could have gone to other rentals and paid N . this was my first trip to chicago and i thought i was choosing a hotel within walking distance of the shopping and restaurants on the magnificent mile and i was wrong . the first night we walked and had to take a taxi back because it was simply too far for the kids . 
great location and the staff was super nice too , . . . but the rest is just an older hotel , period . i want to give it more than N because of the location and how easy everything is . . . but i just can ' t . the bathroom is super tiny , . . . don ' t even try getting ready to leave the room at the same time as your spouse . . . forget it ! some of the appointments are very tired and in need of an update . wall paper , fixtures , etc . nothing terrible , but noticable . i would go back for a quick weekend trip . the staff was nice and helpful , and as i said , the location is superb ! if i could give it a N . N i would , but i just quite can ' t give it a N . 
i loved it here ! my boyfriend and i booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our N nights here . ( i ' ve paid more to stay at the santa barbara motel N ! ! ) gorgeous hotel , great staff , fun bar lounge area and we were most impressed with the room . the large windows in the bathroom were the best--i took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of navy pier and the skyline . i remember thinking , " this is really living . . . " the room was comfortable and quiet , again with great views just like in the bathroom . chicago is a wonderful town--i have nothing but good things to say about it . can ' t wait to come back ! 
just a couple of blocks off n . michigan shopping and on the bus line . stayed here when it was the holiday inn N years ago and since into a nice property . 
booked into this hotel without really knowing the area , and wasn ' t really thrilled about the neighborhood . it ' s a bit of a remote location if you ' re a tourist , especially if you ' re used to staying on the loop or on mag mile the hotel is the tallest building on that side of the interstate , and it ' s only about N stories . check-in was frustrating we tried for an early check-in and were told the room would be ready in " about an hour " so we wandered to the adjacent grocery store and camped out in the starbucks there , as a rowdy wedding party had taken over the hotel lobby upon returning , we were told it would be another " half hour or so " and that pattern kept up for a full N hours or so . . . honestly if they ' d said it would be N hours from the get-go , we ' d have gone and done something , not hung around the lobby ! once in the room , the furnishings were quite nice , simple but stylish fairly comfortable bed ( the mister liked it more than i did ) , and everything very clean . we had a balcony but didn ' t spend much time on it . hotel gives free wi-fi which works quite well in the lobby and is painfully slow in the guest rooms . there is quite a bit of freeway noise but oddly it becomes soothing , like a white noise machine , after a bit . some of the doormen ( particularly the one who stored our bags ) are a bit surly . had breakfast at the adjacent hotel , dine . food was quite nice and prices were very good , especially by hotel standards . service , on the other hand , was completely absent . overall , i wouldn ' t stay here again simply because of the location they do charge mag mile rates and it ' s not a neighborhood that should command those prices . 
my boyfriend and i stayed at the avenue crown plaza for N nights . the hotel is half block off the magnificent mile and across the street from northwestern medical center . we walked to millennium park and oats beach . our king room was large with ample blankets . the bathroom was clean and spacious . we had a wonderful room with a view of michigan ave . the professional staff greeted us by name each time we passed through the lobby . the valet staff was courteous and quick with a compliment . the workout room is small but adequate . i would stay here again and again . 
the drake hotel is an excellent choice for anyone interested in staying along the ' magnificent mile ' . we arrived at the hotel about Nam and were very pleased when we were upgraded to a jr . suite and immediately given our room keys . our room was very large and very beautifully decorated . the hotel is convenient to all of the best shopping as well as the oak street beach area , which was fun to visit as well . my only ' complaint ' was that there was no where particularly close to walk to and grab a cup of coffee , but this was a small price to pay for such a beautiful hotel and location . i would definitely recommend this hotel . 
i am platinum elite with marriott and much to my surprise and disappointment upon checking in this past friday for a N night weekend stay was closure of the club lounge for the weekend . . . . actually every weekend . thinking there had to be alternative benefits ( breakfast in the restaurant , drinks at the bar . . . anything ! ) i inquired and was told rudely by the " elite check-in desk " staff that they would not offer me anything else , other than the spartan " welcome amenity . " not taking this without more inquiring , i called guest services and was given the same answer . clearly they encounter upset elite members on weekends and are ready with their abrupt and non-accommodating responses . my beef isn ' t as much with the lack of club access , but with the lack of notice by the hotel with my confirmation and the lack of an alternative benefit to make up for it . had i known this in advance , i would have stayed elsewhere ( and i assume they know this . . . thus why they don ' t tell you ) . i am diamond with hyatt and gold with hilton and have never run into this before . . . without at least some other benefit to make up for the lack of club access . clearly the marriott downtown chicago does not value elite guests . . . at least not on weekends . as for the rest of the hotel , it ' s fine , but nothing special . they ' ve spruced up the lobby , but the rooms are small , especially the bathrooms , and d cor is dated . plus this was the first hotel i have stayed at in a long time that does not have in-room wifi , only a single ethernet cable . there is wifi in the lobby though . i found this frustrating when using devices like my ipad and laptops . as for the positive , the location on michigan ave . is convenient and the restaurant named harvest had a tasty for breakfast buffet . however , be prepared to shell out a hefty N per person if it ' s not part of your room rate . my assessment . . . i won ' t stay here again . there are too many other hotels in the immediate area that offer better rooms and services that make the chicago marriott downtown a hotel that needs to reevaluate their competition and how they treat elite members . 
we was to the fairfield chicago for N nights in september , and that was second stay in " marriott " hotels in chicago . this hotel had really good price ( for good room , large , with sofa , N tv ' s ) at a higher floor . the room ( bed ) was confy , the hotel is really near michigan ave , good restaurants near the room and parking near the hotel . i go back to chicago next month and i will go back to this hotel ! 
the tremont is in a fantastic location for shopping at N n michigan or water tower place or going out in the city . the service by the staff was very pleasant and we had no issues . the valet stand attendants were great in getting us cabs and tending to our luggage . the room we stayed in was on the smaller side , the bathroom needed updating ( especially the paper thin towels ! ) , but the one main drawback was how thin the walls were . to not feel like a voyeur , i had to turn on the old tv to drown out the romantic activities of our neighbors . that was a bit uncomfortable . the price paid was reasonable ( use aaa ) for the city , but watch out for the outrageous valet charges for cars ( N day ) . this is pretty typical i found out , but still , it ' s a lot of money ! we also really enjoyed the food and hospitality at mike ditka ' s restaurant , attached to the tremont . overall , if you won ' t spend much time in your room , this might be a real find ! 
we have stayed here several times with our children , most recently in august N . the rooms are one bedroom suites with a living area that has a pull-out sofa , so mom and dad can have some privacy while the kids have their own place to sleep . the hotel is adjacent to the hancock tower so you ' re not far from everything . my only complaint is that the wireless internet access seems awfully slow . otherwise , we would stay here again with our children . 
we were greeted right away by the front desk person , tommie , who was very welcoming . he made sure everything was taken care of and was just overall great . the room ( a suite ) was small but clean and perfectly fine . the rooftop pool was wonderful , surrounded by chairs and very breezy which was welcome in super-steamy chicago . the food in the attached restaurant is also very good , we ate there twice . good pizza , excellent spaghetti ! would definately stay here again . 
what i look for in a hotel room is comfort but i didn ' t find that here . the rafaello is quite small and old to me . the service received was great , very friendly staff , but it stops there . 
a surprise Nth birthday gift of an overnight stay at the drake was the beginning of a lovely , lovely weekend . i have lived in chicago all of my life and have never stayed at this wonderful hotel . location of the drake is outstanding , the lobby is elegant , the coq d ' or lounge had lovely musical entertainment , my room had a wonderfully comfortable bed and linens , the hallways and room were quiet . the occasional honking of an outside car was part of the urban ambience for me . others might not appreciate that . in that case , request a room with a lake michigan view . it is a pricey hotel , but special pricing is sometimes offered . i would stay there again in a heartbeat ! 
i have booked my trip online and since i have been traveling without a car , i needed to stay in downtown . the location of the hotel was excellent and we had a room with a river view which was fantastic . this hotel also connects to the mall so the entrance is little bit tricky . there is an au bon pain next to the hotel which i have visited couple times for breakfast . i would definitely stay in this hotel again . 
stayed here recently for N nights and found the hotel really nice . located conviently for most things in chicago right on the riverfront . hotel itself looked fairly modern and staff were really friendly and helpful ( we had an error with the phones which we didn ' t know , and were charged N but the staff wiped the bill for us , which was a nice touch ) . would definately stay here again ! 
this was my second vacation to chicago ( Nst week of sept N ) and after lots of research and advice we chose to stay in embassy suites lakefront , downtown . this is an excellent hotel to stay in chicago . the suite was big enough to accommodate a decent family size ( we were N ) with even high school grade children . the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of downtown and is literally steps from all the places to visit like navy pier , magnificent mile , water tower , river cruises , restaurants , top shopping malls theaters and lot more . the area is family friendly and you can wonder around even in the late evening hours with family . the breakfast buffet package was fabulous and it had huge variety to select from and every thing to interest even the most selective eaters . the staff at the breakfast was very polite , professional and helpful . the room was clean and had two flat panel tv ' s so that children can watch there stuff in there room and you have your own screen to enjoy . surprisingly the room was big enough to have a small kitchenette , dinning table set , study , sofa bed and an extra vanity to help a family with early morning washroom rush . the house keeping staff was excellent and the room was cleaned and done nicely each evening when we returned back from all day tour . the room was very quite and no downtown noise even though it was on Nth floor and facing street and river . i will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone and you will not be disappointed with the price , quality , food and the luxury of the suite . for us this was worth every penny . i must mention that i like to travel frequently with family a few times every year and always stay in downtown of mega cities . this was " excellent experience " and will always look for embassy suites in future . congratulations to management and staff , keep it up . s choudry
i came to visit downtown chicago fir the first time on a weekend getaway for some shopping and sightseeing with my boyfriend . i thought this hotel would be great based on the star ratings and location . to keep things short -- front desk customer service was rude -- we booked online and we arrived from a long flight ( N hr red eye ) just to tell us that we can wait for N hours or look for another hotel rooms were clean , comfortable bed but very outdated ( it ' s known to be the oldest building in chicago , so understandable ) although location was great ! ! ! N-N minute walk to restaurants , shopping district , and many attractions . 
we were so pleasantly surprised by this hotel ! we got into chicago a night earlier than we ' d planned , and couldn ' t get a room at the sheraton , where we had a reservation to stay the rest of the week . we made an online reservation at the conrad hotel without seeing a picture of it , and when we arrived in chicago we were amazed at how wonderful this hotel was . we have two small daughters , N and N , and the staff was wonderful with them , even sending up milk and cookies to our room the first night . after our first night , we cancelled our reservations at the sheraton because we loved the conrad so much . it ' s attached to a great mall ( with a lego store for our girls to play in ! ) and the location of this hotel is as perfect as you could as for - right by the chicago river on michigan avenue , across the street from the chicago tribune building and a block from the wrigley building . a perfect experience , and everyone from the front desk to the bell desk to the room service employees were fantastic . we never expected to have such a great time at a hotel that looked like it ' d be too nice for us to stay in with our little ones ! and , a great price ! we payed almost N less per night than we would have paid at the sheraton ! ! ! the conrad was great , and saved us a ton of money ! any time we return we ' ll only stay at the conrad ! 
nice hotel . pleasant staff . rooms were very nice , but ours was quite small . i thought it was still a good value , because we paid less for the room than what i could have paid at a comparable hotel in the area . for N nights it was fine , and we didn ' t spend a lot of time in the room . the location is excellent . short walking distance to willis tower and the art institute . a bit longer walk to cross the river and go into the heart of the magnificent mile . took a cab back home from the water tower for about N including tip . there is a starbucks right outside the front door and plenty of other places around for a good , close , cheap breakfast . i would highly recommend valet parking for the few extra dollars you pay , especially if you are checking in during the week as the traffic is insane and there is nowhere good to park your car to drop off luggage . if i wanted to stay in that part of chicago again , i would certainly consider staying at this hotel again . 
we booked thru hotels . com ( mistake N ) . when the N of us got to the silversmith they did not have a room with two beds for us . they had a choice of two very small rooms with one bed and a roll-a-way bed . they did not even offer for us to have both rooms . when we said this is not acceptable they said that they couldn ' t do anything about it since we booked thru hotels . com . we were only guaranteed a room , not a room with two beds . the l train is right in front of the hotel and kind of loud . the night we were there there was a shooting in that neighborhood . we only stayed there one night and will never stay there again . 
this was my first time visiting chicago , and i booked the allerton through hotels . com . the hotel is in a perfect location on the magnificent mile . we walked pretty much everywhere we went . there is an l station a few blocks away . the room was not huge , but it ' s a big city and it ' s expected . the room was very clean , bed very comfortable and the bathroom was great . the lobby is not on the bottom floor , which is a little awkward . however , the bell men are great and ensure you get your luggage to the right place . the lobby was nice , with a firepit and a great bar to relax in at the end of the day . i didn ' t interact with the staff all too much , but when i did , they were very friendly and helpful . i couldn ' t see any reason not to recommend staying here for your trip to chicago ! 
i stayed at the james with my boyfriend back in august for a N day trip to chicago . we found a good value on expedia and based on the positive reviews , we decided to book it . we are very glad we did - the bed was extremely comfy ! we also loved the " modernized " look of our room . for our next visit to chicago this summer , we will definitely stay here again . ps it is in an extremely convenient location . near the subway and shopping . literally right beside the luxe ( wonderful place for lunch ) . 
stayed here in march due to family illness . my Nst time in a motel as i normally stay in the bigger hotels with flight deals . this place did not disappoint as other posters on here have said . this did help me decide on staying here . the room is spacious with a queen bed , tv , fridge , table chairs etc . the staff are very friendly helpful . they do a breakfast bun , bagel , fruit , orange juice and coffee . if you need to go down town you can order a yellow cab and costs about N - N dollers over all i would definately stay here again when in chicago . 
stayed at the embassy suites downtown for N nights to attend a business conference . the location is fantastic , with no need to rent a car if you can make it to the hotel without one ( take the airport shuttle or taxi ) . everything is in walking distance , great restaurants close by , and in a safe area . the front desk managed to find a free king suite upon my request at check in , since i had been reserved a double by mistake . rooms kept clean , the bed was very comfortable , absolutely no problems with the room . the extra value is in the daily breakfast and manager ' s reception . even if the line seems long at breakfast , it moves quickly , and there are always tables available by the time you need one . the nightly happy hour is a nice change from the N dollar drinks you will pay at area restaurants , so take advantage of it if you ' re so inclined . not premium brands , but hey , it ' s free . it was also very nice to be greeted upon returning from to the hotel each evening with a friendly , " welcome home ! " by the porter . they seem to make an effort to be friendly and warm . i would use this hotel again . 
had a great stay at chicago marriott downtown mag mile . the location was perfect for all of the sightseeing in chicago , most in walking distance . the lobby had a great atmosphere and was a nice place to stop and check email ( you pay for internet in the rooms , but free wifi in lobby ) . our room was spotless ! the bathroom was on the small side , but i would trade cleanliness over a larger bathroom anyday . the service was great , we asked for a fridge upon check-in and it was delivered by the time we got back in from sightseeing . concierge staff was helpful with directions . there are plenty of options to eat and drink in the direct vicinity of the hotel . there were restaurants everywhere you looked . we did not get a chance to eat at the hotel restaurant so can ' t comment on that . 
if you dont wish to stay in downtown chicago , and lakeview is your favorite part of town , you cant go wrong with this place . . . very clean , comfy , little breakfast and great location . . so dont be discouraged by the best western sign , its way better ! 
i love that city , its a great place to get lost in . . . the hotel essex was great , the help was friendly , helpful , the pool was great . your right in the middle of things , the hustle and bustle . i would of stayed longer , but oh well you have to go home sometimes . 
i had a quit trip to chicago , and decided to try a hotel i have heard about , but never had an opportunity to visit the allerton hotel . what a great decision i made . my first impression was that the hotel staff was there to make my life easier . i was greated at my cab and the service was top notch from then on . there was a long line for check in , but instead of making people wait , additional staff came to help ( loved this ) . before bringing my bags up , they called to make sure it was a " good time for me " . . . . a simple task , but was appreciated . from directions from the bellman , to service at the lounge , it was one of the best experiences of service i have had . oh , and by the way , the rooms are beautifully decorated , cozy and had everything i needed . no need to mention that its a great location . i love staying at a hotel where i can walk everywhere , i only needed a cab to get me back to the airport . for work travel or leisure , this place makes travel easy and enjoyable . 
we were very pleased with our choice of hotel for the conference we attended . we had over N rooms booked and not a problem to be found ! the location was central to our conference venue ( mccormick place ) and in a safe environment in the city . the rooms were clean and updated , the breakfast was great with plentiful choices . the best part of the stay were the wonderful attentive staff on hand - it was more like concierge service ! with the many changes additions that were made to our group ' s stay , the staff was professional , courteous and more than helpful . when we come back to chicago - we will be staying here ! 
we got a great rate at this hotel ( N . N total ) for saturday night ( valentines day ) and we are glad we chose to stay here . this hotel does not have the fancy entryway foyer area , but oh my . . . . . what a wonderfully decorated room . this room was newly remodeled , with very current and new furniture , fresh paint and even a flat screen N inch hd tv ! ! ! ! ! we have stayed at many downtown hotels and have never had a room this " roomy " ! ! we had a king room and it was huge for downtown . this room and hotel is going to he our N choice from here on out , what a gem ! there is a rosebud prime around the corner and also a rosebud italian restaurant a block away , both great eats ! ! if you are going to stay downtown for a romantic getaway , look no further . . . . . . . hampton inn downtown majestic is the place to stay , hands down ! ! hampton inn . . . . . . . . . you have yourself a gem here ! ! 
if you want to sleep during your stay at this hotel , don ' t get a room on the Nth floor ! ( starwood preferred level ) the doors are paper thin and you hear every other guest ' s door slam shut starting at about Nam . there ' s about a Ninch gap under each door , so light blasts in throughout the night ( i did thow a couple pillows there to block the light and sound , but didn ' t work . ) the door dividing the adjoining guest room is completely ridiculous . . . it ' s so thin , you can hear the other guest using the bathroom and brushing their teeth . service from hotel staff is lacking . no one takes ownership for problems with the exception of one front desk agent named kira who was really amazing . 
this is a really great hotel in downtown chicago just off magnificent mile . it is has a wonderful art deco lobby in creams and yellows with dark wood . the rooms are large and beautifully appointed in pale greens , dark wood and gorgeous bedding . great restaurant , ben pao right across the street . had a fantastic dinner after a long day of travel . went to bed only to discover that opposite the hotel is the fire department . so in the middle of the night , on more than one occasion , we were woken by the sirens of the emergency vehicles heading out on calls . we won ' t be able to stay there again which is a shame because if it wasn ' t for the sirens we would rate this hotel a five star ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
i tried them three times and each time they messed up my reservation . since my flight time gets me to the hotel about midnight there is little room for error - one time they actually checked me and sent me upstairs to a room that hadn ' t been cleaned . going back and forth to the lobby after a long day of travel is not my idea of good service . this last time - and it will be the last time- i had reserved a studio room , i had called the day of arrival to confirm that they had my reservation correct , was assured that they did , only to arrive at midnight and find that they were completely full and the only room available was a smaller room - which they thought they would charge me the higher rate for . to put a bad punctuation mark on a bad entry there was no internet available in that tiny room . i had not had that problem before , two calls to the front desk and the problem was still not resolved by morning . i would not recommend this hotel . the beds are pretty hard which some people like . 
stayed in room N in early june for N nights . stayed in the " main " tower this trip , but have stayed in the other on a previous trip . the room was very fresh with a partial view of the river . has all the usual amenities and furnishings of a hyatt . the staff was friendly and helpful . agree with other posters that the eating options are high - a bagel was N at the self serve and . N at starbucks up the street . the conference rate was not a bargain , but on previous stay got a great rate on hotwire . location is certainly great . i walked up the magnificant mile to N michigan stores , back down along the lake and then up the river walk . had lunch at the park cafe looking straight up at the " bean " and then walked down to the art institute . bottom line , great location , comfortable room , friendly staff and can be a good value . i would stay again . 
the hotel , as a whole , was great . the only N things that i thought left something to be desired , was the service at the restaurant and use of the business center . as far as the restaurant , most of the wait staff were clueless . each morning ( N of them ) , we had to wait and wait and wait . simple things like juice and ketchup were hard to get . although my company covered expenses , i thought N for eggs , home fries and toast was quite steep . ( N and up for a bagel and lox . ) i am a frequent business traveler , but never seem to get used to the prices in hotel restaurants . i tip quite generously , and one would have thought that the wait staff would remember a good tipper and make sure we were taken care of . ( not that others should be neglected ! ! ) the business center was rediculously over-priced . make sure you have your laptop and print whatever you need elsewhere ! ! on a good note , the staff were very accomodating , polite and helpful . the rooms are large , modern and clean . absolutely no reservations about staying there again , on business . 
have stayed here many times for business and with family . love the " parking included " ! always very friendly staff . location is very handy , great dinning within walking or taxi . rooms always clean , some are a bit small but not bad , comfortable beds . restaurant on property is reasonable . some hotel packages available through chicago attractions--check on the web ! this place makes going to chicago on a budget very appealing--will return . 
our family of N travels quite a bit so we ' ve had lots of hotel " experiences " . the amalfi was one of our most pleasant stays . the staff was friendly and helpful , the hotel clean , and the afternoon happy hour was divine ! each staff person we encountered seemed to enjoy their work and performed in top form . i believe this also reflects on the management - happy work environments create happy workers ! cudos to the trustworthy housekeeping staff who returned my forgotten " stuff " . some of these things were vacation purchases that still had tags on . they were returned in a timely manner intact . we will see you on our next visit to your beautiful city . the blake family from winter park , florida
stayd there july Nnd . . . room was smelly and outdated with a few new add-ons . . . . room was small as hell . . . . . no pool . . . N to park and they took forever to retrieve the car . . . . . . . we had a bill of N left under our door for a weed smell ? ? ! ! ! which was false and obsurd ! ! ! the whole hotel smelled of b . o ( body odor ) and gym socks . . . my hubby went the fu off on them . . pack our belongings and we checkd out . . . . . so that foul odor was . ur hotel and . lack of . cleaning . . . . stayd at avenue crown plaza on huron and luvd it . . . dont stay here the smell is dreadful and the staff are lying , under achiever , minimum wage working a s pple ( rude fu s ) . . . yes im still pissed
second stay at the knickerbocker . happened to go on one of the busiest weekends of the summer . tall ships , lolapolluza , art festival , cubs and white sox all going on . the room we stayed in was clean and nice . the only downfall is the fact that we had to sleep in a murphy bed . no N star hotel should have a murphy bed . beyond that , the staff was very helpfull and made the stay enjoyable . 
this hotel is really clean and so comfortable . it was a last minute reservatio and i am so glad that i stayed here . the staff was helpful and friendly . check in and out were hastle free and the entire stay was a pleasure . 
i stayed in chicago for N nights during a conference in november . the conference venue was at the hyatt regency , just a couple of blocks away from the comfort suites . the hotel was considerably cheaper , included internet and breakfast , pretty much everything the conference hotel didn ' t have . in addition , the location was superb next to the river on michigan ave , walking distance from shops , cafes , sightseeing locations , etc . the room was huge ! almost a self contained apartment with a kitchen , fridge , oven , room to iron , etc . the corridor was a bit smelly ( like a pipe burst or something ) , but the smell didn ' t go into the room . i will definitely stay here again if i ' m back in chicago ! 
we love this hotel . we take the train from o ' hare , which costs N . N ( one way ) . there is as stop right around the corner from the hotel . there is also a station right out the door of the hotel . it ' s very conveniently located as far as walking or taking the train . it ' s inside the loop . a very nice , comfortable hotel with a lobby that compares to few . sitting in the lobby having drinks and appetizers is so relaxing . we will stay at the palmer house any time we visit chicago . it ' s worth every penny . great rooms , great service and a beautiful hotel . 
four of us stayed at the hampton for a " girls ' day ( s ) out " and had a terrific experience . the hotel ' s mission decor was delightful , the linens luxurious , the rooms much larger than expected and absolutely spotless , and the staff exemplary . since we are all " of a certain age , " we were a bit concerned about venturing out sans husbands , but the staff was so helpful that our concerns vanished within N minutes . they gave us excellent advice and were so efficient about making ( and changing ) dinner reservations . when we checked out , they told us they would miss us and begged us to stay another day . believe me , we would have loved the opportunity since chicago is such a great city and the people ( and taxi drivers ) so friendly . we found the area very safe and walked almost everywhere , though we did take taxis to michigan ave . so we could conserve our strength for shopping ! we found excellent restaurants in the area , particularly le colonial ( french vietnamese , very upscale ) and keefers for steaks ( a bit pricey but absolutely delicious ) . also liked weber ' s grill for a quick , modestly priced meal before the theater ( very good ribs ) . the hotel breakfast was more than adequate and so convenient . though i am normally not a fan of hampton inns ( except for overnight stops when we are on the road ) , this one is definitely vacation quality at a good price . i look forward to returning with my husband for a longer stay . 
the hotel staff were very friendly and personable . the hotel was very tastefully done . although we were given one of the older rooms it was very clean . the furniture was a bit dated but that didnt affect the stay . the hotel was right next door to the john hancock building . on tuesday there is a farmers market one block away . you are within walking distance of anything you would want . and the bus system is wonderful . get a pass at the visitors center at the clock tower one block from the hotel . the pass is only N a day all you want to ride and transfer . we love the original pancake house for breakfast . ate there at least N times . also love the cheese cake factory for what else the cheese cake . take the boat tour of the city . it is truly beautiful . we found to be very safe in the area we were staying which is also only a brief couple blocks from lake michigan . i would definitely recommend a stay at the seneca and will definitely stay there again . remember though chicago is very expensive . but ask the locals and they will tell you of some good cheap eats . try ronnies in the theatre district . buffet style diner but fantastic if not the best steak i have ever eaten . 
we chose to stay at this hotel for my birthday weekend . the description of this hotel sounded right up my ally . we get there and have problems from the beginning with they way they kept trying to charge my credit card . music was too loud to hear what any of the front desk people were saying . we get into our tiny room and discover writing on the walls . a hot stuffy room with a air conditioner that barely works . a few of the many expensive snacks in the room had already been opened by previous guest and i was hoping my credit card wouldn ' t be charged for them . the design of the lobby and vibes that were thrown off were really nice . i just wish we hadn ' t ran into the issues we had . full review can be found here - www . -------------------- . com N N w-chicago-city-circle-hotel . html
i arrived at the sofitel for a joint leisure and business . it is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable . the rooms are spacious , great beds , pillows and linen . the bathroom has a great shower and bath . wifi works really well and the desk is large . the staff are wonderful . the location is great for shopping , spa ' s , starbucks and hairdressers . i loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it . 
modern and majestic modern hotel with amazing amenities . very friendly staff . great pool , gym , and spa . very high quality food in retraunt . overall excellent experience . 
we stayed here N night to go to american girl doll store and do some shopping . the hotel is in an excellent location--N broke from michigan ave . the room was very clean and they held our bags as would arrived early and could not check in . the front desk rep i think his name was gomez as great . i would stay here again in a heartbeat . got a great rate on travelzoo at N a night
we stayed at the hyatt regency on east wacker for five nights , from april N - april N . all i can say is that the savvy traveler either books elsewhere , or she brings along everything that you ' d expect an upscale hotel to offer . despite the fact that a huge conference was underway , we had no problems with check-in , and although we ' d booked through hotwire , it appears our room was larger and better-designed than others described ( or photographed ) here . the overall cleanliness was also fine . that ' s the good part . unfortunately , using the hotel ' s mini-hair dryer resulted in a blown breaker every day . the dryers are attached to the wall , so you can ' t move to a different outlet , and we eventually requested that an electrician check the dryer . he said the problem is that the wiring in parts of the hotel is insufficient for the demand--and i was getting up before N a . m . daily . the hotel offers no robes , and they ' re remarkably tight-fisted with the toiletries--in five days , we got fresh soap , lotion , etc . only once . we also had to call for coffee two of the five days--and on days when housekeeping did refresh our coffee supply , they typically left one sugar creamer packet . given the poor fit of the door , our room was subject to both the light and noise from the hallway all night long . the worst problem , however , was the total lack of ventilation . there was no fan in the bath , and although it was possible to regulate our heat , the fan in the room was insufficient to ever clear out the humidity from showers so the room constantly felt damp . our view was fine , but it was obscured by condensation on the inside of the window because of the humidity . this hyatt offered a service called the " exceptional stay . " given the lack of attention to the details you ' d expect from an upscale hotel , i think they have a way to go to move beyond the " okay stay " mark . 
we stayed N nights . some staff are excellant and could not do enough others are only ok and don ' t care . we checked in after a late arrival and they advised they had upgraded us toa studio . we had booked a king room and when we got to the studio it was a queen and was a smoking room . when we rang down it was like sorry there are no other rooms in the hotel . not quite an upgrade . bikes for free are good and concierge efficient at directing . rooms are nice , good size in the studi . hallways and lifts and lobby dated and smell a little . the steakhouse is excellant food . they gave us complimentary breakfast for the smoking room when i complained but it was only one thing on the menu and then they charged us on our bill . we went to stay at the w for the next N days and liked it better . we got a very good rate on expedia but if it was above N a night i would not stay here
the majestic is simply that as a nice quaint cute neighborhood hotel within walking distance to everything . i have been staying here since it was the brompton and love the fresh touches every time i come back . this past stay was wonderful from my check-in with richard to my delightful conversation with mona . the staff is great . rooms are great , while they are chicago size , they are clean and comfortable . i love the beds at this hotel . love the large bathroom as well . the majestic makes you feel comfortable and at home . 
stayed here for just one night after an evening on the town . room was quite large with a king bed , small desk , nice side chair and table . visually pleasing design . large flat screen tv was new . bedding i found to be pretty average , and a little skimpy on the pillows . bathroom was again very nicely sized . tub and shower were pretty average . nice towels and complimentary toiletries . complimentary wine service in the evening was a nice touch . did not use the gym , but it was pretty small . looked like about N total machines ( treads , elliptical , bike ) . equipment looked pretty new but it ' s a tight space . great service from the valet . parking was N night w in-out privilege . front desk staff was good . first rep gave me a room on N next to the gym . i was concerned about noise , and they were able to move us to another room far from elevators , etc . no drama , very professional . i would stay here again w o hesitation however , i find i have a preference for a more classic presentation vs . the ' hipness ' of this boutique hotel . ask yourself do you prefer a white bathrobe , or leopard print bathrobe ? hotel monaco is all about the animal prints . 
very nice hotel , worth the price , room was clean , in room computer was a huge bonus . . . loved it . traveling from upstate ny and looking forward to returning to the hyatt . 
i booked three nights here via hotwire for business and yes , the rooms are a bit small , but very comfortable and up to date . i did laugh when i banged my shin on corner of bed , as that seems to be a common complaint , but i did not mind the room at all . windows open , bed comfortable , bathroom has standup shower with big tiles and terrazzo floor , and big rainhead . very nice . rooms might be too small for a couple with a lot of luggage , but if you ' re traveling light , this seems to be a great choice . the shower didn ' t have water for an hour so they offered me a N voucher in the elate restaurant downstairs , which i thought was a nice gesture . staff was very nice , especially the guys who work the door . i parked across the street in lot which is N night . starbucks a block and a half away and the kerryman bar a block away had great food . free wifi also . 
staying at the hard rock in chicago is always a great experience . the location just south of the river on michigan ave . offers excellent views no matter what side of the hotel your room is on . clean rooms , comfortable beds and service that is fast and friendly make this the place to stay in chicago ! ! 
room N over the memorial day weekend . i have stayed at the ritz carlton and the four seasons here in chicago and they don t even come close to the pen . this hotel and their staff are exceptional ! the rooms are luxurious with large bathrooms featurein spererate tubs , shower and wc . there is a tv in front of the tub , a sitting area for the ladies and a lighting systems that took almost N days to figure out ! they do not nickel dime you on the extras like free internet which was fast and ample complimentary water bedside when turndown service was performed . the spa is a bit small but quite nice along with a narrow lap pool , hot tub , and small sun deck on the Nth floor facing east with stunning views of water tower place . the bar is well stocked , but expensive . we ate only in the lobby lounge for a late lunch and everything was quite good . the public areas are terrific , on the modern side with dramatic staircases . special thanks to kenneth , our concierge who recommended a very good restaurant . we can t wait to return . 
not fancy , no frills . . . just what we needed to be frugal on a room where we spent barely a wink . ( who spends time in your room in chicago ? ) everywhere we went we walked everywhere was within N mins . desk staff was helpful when asking questions . perfect for people on a budget , or wanting to spend money elsewhere in the city ! not to mention . . . free parking ! 
for the same price as nearby hotels , i got a N-room suite . bedroom with king bed , bathroom with toilet and shower separated by a door from the sink and closet . also a big kitchen living room and desk . free wireless didn ' t work in my room but did work in the lobby . staff was very helpful and offered to have me move rooms but the wired internet worked so i stayed in my original room and it worked great . kitchen had everything you would need for an extended stay . great location by restaurants , shopping and bars . full breakfast is free in the morning , as well as full dinner every evening . i ' m going to try to stay here every possible time i visit chicago . 
my boyfriend and i stayed at the knickerbocker over new years and checked out on the Nnd of january . we used hotwire and got this hotel . from the outside the knickerbocker looked great . i was worried when i read the reviews and well . . . they were pretty right on . we checked in about noon on the Nst but the room wasn ' t ready so we went down michigan to do some shopping . location is great , i do admit . we came back around N Npm and our room was ready . we were situated on the Nth floor at the end of the hall . we settled in and right away i noticed that the walls to the room are paper thin . i couldn ' t tell if my neighbour was opening his door or our door . when people talked in the room you can hear their exact conversation . the room was quite small and dark . i think we had a queen bed . the room was really musty smelling . i ' m sensitive but my boyfriend is not and he suggested lighting my travel candle . i suggest bringing one . the furnishings and decor were really out of date . their was a canopy over the top part of the bed and a mirror above your head . it was kind of spooky looking in my opinion . one of the pillow covers are covered in an old textile and i didn ' t trust it to be clean so i only used the one white pillow to sleep on . the bathroom had no bathtub , shower only . the tiles in the bathroom kind of looked old and dirty in my opinion . the bath products were no name so luckily we had our own to use . the clock radio has a cd players so that was a bonus as is the large tv in the room . we celebrated nye downstairs in the bar . they were very kind enough to let us order pizza and eat it there . the only thing that bothered me was the cigar smoke . i know it ' s new year ' s but it ' s gross . i used to be a smoker so i can complain . my clothes stank when i went back up to our room . when i went back to the room i smelled cigarette smoke . i don ' t know if it was from the hall or our neighbours but i know smoke when i smell it . the mini-bar fridge is like a vending machine so if you are looking to store leftovers from dinner or something , you can ' t . i don ' t think that i ' ll stay here again if i had a choice . i suggest going to a website called ------- to get an idea of what hotel you might get from sites like hotwire and priceline . 
good hotel in a nice area within walking distance to good restaurants and shopping . 
stayed here two nights for a business meeting . walking distance to rush st . bars , but no in-room coffee pots , so morning can be difficult . flatscreen tv , N phones , desk , reading chair , dresser , N end tables . bose cd alarm clock . very nice closet , and a terrific , comfortable king-sized bed . dial thermostat worked fine standard smoke detector and sprinkler . beautiful well-lit closet . seperate tub and shower with good height , well-lit mirror , and plenty of hot water . no great view from the southwest side . i parked in the parking garage next door which is not affiliated with the hotel and had no issues . internet is an extra N per day which i did not pay for . check in was a N minute wait to find out they had no rooms ready ( at noon ) , i returned at N N and waited another N minutes for my key . at checkout i had to revisit the desk and waited about N minutes for by bill to checkout ( just before Nam ) . also , no newspaper at the door during my stay . 
every january , several girlfriends go to chicago for a weekend of shopping , dining , theater , and fun . we have known each other for N years , and have been coming to embassy suites , downtown chicago for the last N years . roberto , the doorman recognizes us each year , and gives us a warm welcome each time . the staff is always friendly , accomodating and efficient . richard , the concierge was very helpful this year , obtaining our boarding passes for our trip home , and last year secured us seats at the last minute for jersey boys . we love this hotel , and would recommend it to everyone we know that wants a home away from home when they travel to chicago . the location is perfect , the breakfasts are wonderful , the suites clean and spacious . great place ! ! ! mj phillips farmington hills , mi
we just stayed at the park hyatt chicago for the first time . our american express card had a special for this property so we decided to try it out . we have stayed at many hotels across the country and all types . this was the best by far than many others . they put us on the Nth floor with a gorgeous view of michigan avenue and the lake . the room was a nice size with a window seat , large desk table , a herman miller recliner chair with ottoman , a N " flat screen television and king size bed . the bed had a feather mattress on top of the mattress and the most soft pillows . i have never had a bed that felt like sleeping on clouds ( and we have stayed in many N star hotels ) . i had the best sleep and woke without headaches . the cable satellite tv service was a little weird at times , but not too bad . i can ' t forget the electric curtains and all the light and curtain switches by the bed . my husband couldn ' t get over that . very nice . it was like they thought of everything the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub plus a separate shower and a separate makeup counter with stool . we had plenty of room when we both were getting ready to go out . the small tv in the bathroom was also a thrill for my husband . he could watch the game wherever he was in the room . my husband was offered free shoe shining which he was thrilled to take advantage of . we enjoyed breakfast daily ( in nomi ) that came with our special and they were very accommodating . the pastries and breads were made in house so were very fresh , the eggs are organic and they offered fresh fruit every day . the coffee wasn ' t my favorite , a little bitter , but everybody likes different coffee . the prices for breakfast and drinks were all on the menu they gave us , so there was no surprises with the bill . room service brought our breakfast one morning and the gentleman who delivered it was very friendly and did not push a bill at us waiting for an extra tip as we have had at many hotels . we ate at nomi one evening . it is in the higher price range of meals but is worth it once in awhile . they must have fixed the door situation listed on another review as we did not see anyone from the fitness center or able to view it from the restaurant . most all the staff were wonderful ( you always get one pea in the pod that is not as good , which we had as our server at breakfast on the second morning , but that happens ) . they called us by name from the very beginning and were always willing to please . they would open doors , greet us when we left and welcomed us back when we returned . they accommodated us with an umbrella on a rainy day and held our bags while we waited for our ride and we sat in the library with fresh tea lemonade ( or coffee if in the morning ) . the hotel is in a great location . perfect for shopping and was easy for our family to pick us up there . there has been so many businesses anymore that have forgotten what service to the customer is . this hotel has brought it back to the forefront . we will definitely returned to this hotel again . when you have had the best sleep ever when traveling , exceptional staff and a nice room , and in a great location , why would we stay anywhere else ? 
i have stayed at the dana in chicago twice over the past two years . my first visit was for three nights , second stay for five . depending on your specific needs , budget , and taste , the dana can range from very good to fantastic . the location is a few blocks off the main drag but it ' s a very easy , safe , and quick walk to reach north michigan avenue or river north . cabs are easily accessible at the front door and the " el " train and bus stops are within a N minute-or-so walk . the dana was a newly built property buily a few years ago . it is modern , with a lot of exposed concrete and glass but still maintains a warm , chicago-style loft feel with wood floors and touches of earthy colors throughout the hotel . there is an excellent spa , good restaurant ( although too many better options out the front door ) , and a slightly-above-average continental breakfast included with all rooms . it would be great for younger or young-at-heart singles and couples . not recommended for families or children due to privacy issues in all rooms and nightlife vibe when the sun goes down . the rooms very good , modern , chicago-style design with partial wood floors , excellent desk work space , sliding loft-style bathroom door , excellent spa-style bathroom with spacious rainfall shower , ( one wall of the shower is glass exposed to the main bedroom area , which is really fun for some guests but maybe not-so-much if you are traveling with friends or family . ) the rooms have excellent in-room amenities for this level price of hotel . high quality music tv systems , very good bed linens , robes slippers , toiletries , wine bar , and shockingly reasonably priced mini-bar snacks . there is at least one floor-to-ceiling window offering standard to impressive city views . excellent natural light in all rooms , although when needed there are blackout shades , if you want to sleep in or have privacy from the nearby buildings . i preferred the upgraded corner room during my second stay since it offered a little more space , two walls of floor-to-ceiling windows , better views , and a small private balcony . be aware , no rooms other than the penthouse suites have bathtubs , the large spa rain-showers were the trade-off , i guess . there is also a fitness center and small computer area , although there is no pool and had to pay for wifi . parking here as with all hotels in chicago equals highway robbery . one area of the hotel that really disappointed this reviewer , was the super cheesy vegas wanna-be roof top bar . i thought the staff , design , music , and skanky little cocktail waitress outfits were far too cheap and vulgar for this hotel . you can have a hip and swanky nightclub and still be sophisticated classy . ( rooftop at the wit hotel got this concept right and is worth the trip over this place . ) other than the free breakfast and spa worth consideration , skip the hotel outlets . in general i have found the service sufficient- never awful or rude but never particularly memorable . overall , i find the dana a very comfortable and stylish hotel with some great amenities and unique touches . if you can find a competetive rate , it ' s a good value and a more interesting experience compared with many of the standard corporate hotels in chicago . other comporable stylish hotels in the area to consider and compare rates include the wit , the sofitel , the james , and the polomar . 
basic business hotel in a prime location at one end of michigan avenue . we had group rates which were fair for a major city but you got what you paid for . room was rather small but clean and bright . the hotel gym , sponsored by reebok , and highly promoted left much to be desired for . it ' s a basic hotel gym . the business center was minimal and you ' re charged for computer usage . this is a pet peeve of mine . business hotels just nickle and dime visitors assuming all expenses will be reimbursed . a few weeks after checkout i recieved a N charge on my credit card . after calling to question the charge the accounting departments " guessed " it was because i had packages deliver to the hotel . i have never been charged in any other hotel for sending packages for events in advance . they quickly removed the charge . one of our group members were delayed due to weather and flight delays . i did request late check in for my group but when my college arrived for his room he was sent to a local sheraton because the westin overbooked . i was in the lobby and noticed many other guests with the same issue . weather happens . . . chicago hotels should be ready for o ' hare delays and late arrivals . besides the overbooking mishaps the front desk staff and staff who organized our group was very professional . some colleges enjoyed the bar steakhouse in the lobby for dinner . i went to the breakfast stand that " proudly serves starbucks " but isn ' t really a starbucks . the coffee was terrible and the banana sour . i wouldn ' t attempt the breakfast danishes . i ' d recommend the westin michigan avenue as long as all you need is a bed and clean room . but there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in chicago . . . namely the w lakeshore for a great property or hotel N for a real deal in the heart of the city . 
typical hampton inn , close to all things in river north area . only N block from navy pier trolley stop . short cab ride to water tower place . hotel is clean . front desk staff is very friendly and helpful . housekeeper put our dolls on the bed so cute . i liked the outdoor patio next to the indoor pool . breakfast area could be bigger . we had a difficult time getting a table in the morning . surprised by the N day parking . please note that the hotel is next to a fire station so you will hear sirens . 
my husband stayed here for two weeks while in the windy city on business and i joined him for a long weekend . you have to ' adjust ' your expectations when staying at the hard rock . it is dimly lit and decked out with rock legends pics , paraphernalia , etc . it is a pretty convenient location being close to a train stop , and walking distance to several parks and other tourists spots . the bar area and restaurant can get pretty lively at night but hey that ' s to be expected . and we didn ' t hear any of it except on our way in and out . there are two different entrances so you don ' t actually have to walk through the more social area on your way to your room . we had a pretty awesome corner room although it didn ' t leave much privacy . they also gave my dh a fridge and microwave since he was there for awhile . one thing that was really weird is that there was a window in the middle of the shower and only a thin shade for privacy . i was a little worried people below could see my silhouette in window so i took pretty quick showers . oh i did i mention there was a pic of billy idol above the toilet ? fun times indeed but the front desk was great and helpful and housekeeping did a good job as well . i would recommend this hotel based on personality but it was certainly an experience . 
excellent hotel ! the customer service was out of this world and the location perfect ! the bar in the lobby was fun with other guests and entertaining bartenders . i definitely would stay at this hotel again . 
overnight stay only . no premium movie channels . breakfast was good and affordable - small sitting area . convenient to convention center ( N mile away ) . overall , for the money , good hotel . 
traveling for a long weekend to chicago to visit relatives and enjoy the city , we obtained our reservation at the palmer house for a great rate . the hotel is beautiful and centrally located however , better access to nightlife can be had by staying north of the river . our room was small but clean . the service was friendly . we did not have a need to use any of the services that others have complained about as being too expensive--so that was a non-issue for us . 
we stayed here for two nights , and i was glad to depart at the end . first of all beds were lumpy . seriously . very uncomfortable mattress and hard pillows . two our bathroom ( huge while oddly shaped ) came with a mini-shower and bathtub . hardly first class . and they only gave us only two bath towels ( isn ' t four the norm ? ) . the toiletries were generic and not nice . bathroom light was harsh fluorescent , and the heat lamp above kept going on and off . the shops are a bit of a hike ( nearest starbucks is a couple of blocks away ) . it ' s sandwiched between the business district and the shopping district in this odd little run down area , so the surrounding ambiance isn ' t nice . get ready to shell out N a night per computer to user the internet . they were not accommodating with a late check out request we had to call twice and practically beg for them to give us a one hour extension . if you ' re looking for an upscale , modern hotel , i ' d recommend checking out the james or the felix , both nearby . 
we stayed here from friday to monday for a weekend getaway . our flight arrived early morning and they had a room ready for us to check into . the room was very clean and the maid service was exceptional . the hotel is located in area where you can easily walk to everything or access mass transit . the staff was helpful when we asked for suggestions and directions . i will definitely stay here again when we are in town . 
redecorated rooms with cheap furniture ( a N-legged coffee table that fell over when you brushed up against it ) , no water pressure in the shower , polyester pillows that were so old flat they were unusable ( we ' re allergic to feather ) , overcharges on the bill ( N for breakfast at the hotel restaurant , which we never visited ) . . . the crowning blow was a buffet breakfast for N set up in the room next door on two consecutive mornings ( at N Nam ! ) , which made sleeping in impossible . when we complained we were told " that they weren ' t doing it tomorrow " . 
this is a great hotel , very hip fashionable . the service was outstanding . the concierge was excellent . the service is aN , everytime you walk in this hotel they open the doors for you . rooms are very cool , N " plasma tv , big king beds , cd dvd player to watch movies . radio by bed has a cd player in it . the hotel has a computer room with pc ' s printer and fax . there is a pool and work out room . trendy bar . security is excellent , you need a card to work the elevator and at night security guards the elevators , only allowing guests through . the hotel overlooks the lake and navy pier and is only a few blocks from michigan avenue so you are very central . also it is a very gay , lesbian , bi , transgendered friendly hotel . i went with my transgendered girlfriend and no one batted an eyelid . 
really nice hotel with the perfect location ! ! ! the tv in my double room broke down so they moved me to a suite at the Nth floor . the suite was amazing with a spectacular view of the busy city-life outside . the staff was really helpful and friendly , however it took a while for us to get our luggage from the bell-boy when we were leaving . i really liked this hotel and i would love to return here ! 
what a great location this hotel has . . . . easy walk to tons of restaurants , michigan ave . , state street , the river , etc . one block from the red line at grand for further trips to chinatown , wrigley field , or the willis tower . i knew from ta that there would be some issues with noise as there is a fire station across the street . the hotel does provide earplugs in the lobby . it wasn ' t the fire station though that was the problem . we had a suite on the back alley side of the hotel , and there was a great deal of noise very early almost every morning from a trash truck or some other service vehicle ! since we had a suite with N doubles , a sofa bed , and a kitchenette , there was plenty of room for my family with N teenagers to spread out . the kitchenette even had granite and stainless steel appliances ! there was a nice island type seating area in it for quick snacks too ! the hotel is one of the few with this great location that provides free wi-fi , complementary hot breakfast , and a usa today or wall street journal daily . we appreciated all these extras especially since the parking was N a night . we definitely would stay here again , but would ask for a street side higher up room if it was available as a suite . 
this is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities . everyone was helpful . the breakfast buffet was wonderful . the bed was " just like home " . we would definitely stay again . a nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home . it was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best . 
i recently stayed at the swissotel in chicago for three nights with my fiance , who was attending a work conference held at the hotel . the hotel is located pretty far out east on wacker drive , just south of the river . ( it ' s located past the hyatt hotel , also on east wacker . ) the location turned out to be a detriment when the under-staffed cab line didn ' t move at all on a busy friday night as we were trying to make a show that evening . it was so inconvenient trying to hail a cab at the hotel that we decided to change our plans the following evening and have dinner at the palm restaurant in the lobby level of the hotel . room service was efficient and edible -- not the best , not the worst . there is a fully equipped minibar as well as a keurig coffee machine ( the kind that uses individual pods to brew coffee ! ) in the hotel room . we had a fantastic view of lake michigan facing south , which was great from the Nnd floor . unfortunately , when we called ahead to the hotel before the trip , i was informed that the gym requires an additional fee of N day . because we were staying at the swissotel with a group booking for my fiance ' s work , both wifi and the fitness center ended up being complimentary . wifi has a charge of N day , otherwise . next year -- for this and other annual meetings that require us to travel to chicago -- we will be staying closer to mag mile on michigan avenue ( likely the conrad or the park hyatt ) . location-wise , the swissotel is a bit out of the way for visitors who enjoy walking around and are attracted to the main tourist attractions downtown . our stay was certainly comfortable , but there are hotels in chicago that are more geared toward leisure family travelers . 
i was a bit skeptical in the raving reviews i saw at first , but i decided to give the elysian a try . after a night , i have to admit , the reviews are absolutely accurate . they are rated no . N for a very good reason . i ' m no stranger to luxury hotels , but elysian is just outstanding in its uniqueness and elegance . the decor in the lobby and the guest rooms definitely have the touch of old time coco chanel but modern at the same time with its cleaniness and simplicity . in the guestroom , there is nothing more you can ask for , comfortable bed , quality toiletry , and even a lint brush . one note , the marble bath tub is among the largest and deepest i have seen in non-suite guest rooms of all high-end hotels . staff members ' friendiness and attention to details are noted everywhere . once i told them that i had a really early flight next morning , they immediately suggested morning calls and hot coffee service . at N in the morning , the coffee they delivered was on-time and delicious . one thing i really appreciated , they anticipated that i was getting ready in the morning , so coffee was delivered by a female staff to avoid possible awkwardness , really impressive ! the only regret i have is not able to stay there for a longer time to enjoy other things it can offer . 
i would like to offer my warm appreciation for the exceptional level of service that i experienced while staying with you last week . i was in town on business and made my first visit to your hotel , but i hope that it is not my last . i was impressed with the high level of taste and sophistication first and later by the consistently gracious hospitality shown to me and my colleague over the course of our N-night stay . every staff member i interacted with , from the bellmen to the housekeepers to the front desk and restaurant staff were truly professional , absolutely top notch . whatever you are doing , keep it up ! 
the hotel is beautiful with wonderful service . i stayed there on a business trip and it was my first time in chicago . everything went so well , the staff was so helpful . it was so easy to get around and i was close to many tourist attractions ! truly a great place to stay , quite a value ! i hope i get to travel there again ! 
location is great , friendly staff and rooms are large , but my first room had a strong smell of cleaning supplies . i switched rooms and when i plugged my computer in under the desk i saw how filthy it was ( see photo ) . unacceptable for a hotel of this category . i found another hotel in the area and checked out the following day . 
we stayed at the fairmont chicago last nite , a place we have stayed at multiple times before . our room had been re-done and not for the better . the fairmont use to reflect the turn of the century french style of the original fairmont in san franciso and had a lovely soigne feel about it . the new room style is like motel N . the carpet is a tissue thin industrial type , the lovely furniture is now laminate over particle board . the desk was relocated away from the window and faces a wall . there are no pictures on the walls other than the vinyl thing over the bed , and no chairs other than the desk chair . when we called to front desk to ask about the missing chairs , they acknowledged that yes , that was a problem . the light fixtures are from home depot , etc , etc , it just wasn ' t a pleasant room to be in . it is still a good sized room and they left the limestone in the shower , but not a quality experience . the restaurant aria is good . very imaginative dishes and a extremely friendly staff . indeed all of the staff is cheerful and makes every effort to make you feel like a guest . although the hotel was built to a excellent standard , the problem appears to be the new ownership skimping on expenses . i think we will look for alternatives in the east side neighborhood . 
the staff at hotel allegro were amazing . the day before our trip i received an email asking if there was anything the hotel could do to make our trip great . i responded by telling them that i planned a surprise trip for my fianc ' s birthday and asked for early check-in . not only did we have an early check in but they upgraded us to a king suite room and surprised us with s birthday card , chocolates and champagne in celebration of my fianc . on top of the superior customer service , the entire staff was wonderful , the hotel was hip and upscale and the location was walking distance to chicago hot spots . next time we are in chicago we will absolutely return to hotel allegro . 
we have stayed at hotels in many parts of the world and our very favorite is the hotel intercontinental on michigan avenue in chicago . the hotel staff is top-notch . they are very well informed , courteous , extremely polite and friendly . the concierge group is outstanding and have never steered us in a wrong direction . our room is always clean and we never have to ask for anything . every time we go back to chicago the intercontinental employees make us feel it ' s our home away from home . we would reccomend this hotel to anyone ( and often do ) . 
this hotel is in a prime location . you are a few blocks from the magnificent mile and the theater district . the river and the lake are literally " right there " . you have a great view of navy pier . the rooms are beautiful . the beds and pillows are dreamy . our bathroom was nice , but not immaculate . this hotel offers everything you may want , but be prepared to pay for it . they have a ridiculous minibar sytem that automatically charges you if you even touch something in the fridge . internet is N . N per day . you have to pay to use the pool ( maybe it ' s worth it we didn ' t use it ) . parking is N per day . despite the constant attempts to get into your wallet , the location and the quality of the rooms make this a fabulous hotel and we plan to go back again . we ' ll just remember to keep the minibar fridge closed . 
my wife and i visited chicago for her Nth birthday . this was the first time we have visited chicago . we stayed at the fairfield on east ontario . we originally picked this hotel due to its location to michigan avenue and for its value as compared to most of the hotels in the area . we truly enjoyed our stay . the entire staff that we interacted with seemed to truly want our stay to be a special one . they suggested restaurants that we should eat at and each suggestion was a home run especially giordano s famous stuffed pizza . one of the hotel clerks asked us when we returned to the hotel late in the afternoon on the next day if we had gone to visit wrigley field . my wife explained that we weren t going to wrigley on her birthday trip but it was something we would consider in the future . we left for an early dinner a little bit later and a night on the town . after we got back to the hotel room , we found a birthday balloon , a personalized cake wishing her happy birthday , and a mini refrigerator waiting for us . we couldn t believe that the hotel clerks ( kenny and carlos ) would go out of their way to do something like this for their guests . she also received a birthday card signed by all of the staff working that afternoon evening . the hotel is only a block and a half east of michigan avenue which basically is only a two minute walk . just down the street is garrett s popcorn which we visited twice . be ready for a line but you must visit garrett s popcorn and make sure to take some home with you when you leave . our room was basic but very clean and it had a good size hdtv . we didn t spend a ton of time in the room but it was just what we needed . maria v . made sure the room was in excellent shape after we returned from visiting the sites each day . the hotel has a very good continental breakfast with quite a few choices to start your day off on a good note . we sometimes heard sirens at night due to the hotels location near a hospital but that won t deter us from staying there again . we truly want to thank kenny , carlos , charles , gudelia , raul , and maria v . for going out of their way to make my wife s Nth birthday a getaway that we will never forget . we want to visit chicago again in the near future and we will definitely stay at this hotel . you can t beat the service , location , and affordability ! ! 
you can ' t beat this location - next to the tribune building the chicago river . the bell hop was joyful and friendly and the front desk was able to check me in at Nam , which i appreciated . the rooms were very clean and the beds really comfortable . restaurants , shopping , and architectural tour boats abound within one to eight blocks . the nonexistent lobby is the only criticism i have of the hotel . there are only N chairs in the lobby so it ' s difficult to use it as a gathering place or to meet someone there , and only one of three airline kiosks was working to print boarding passes . you can check-in for your flight in your room on the computer , but then have to print the pass in the lobby . starbuck ' s off the lobby was convenient , as was argo tea and corner bakery just outside the hotel . we did not eat in the steakhouse but i hear it gets good reviews . the cta train station to the airport is about N blocks , from which you could walk or take a cab . i definitely recommend this hotel .
