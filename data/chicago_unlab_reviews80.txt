i have stayed at this property several times , the hotel is located in south chicago area , at the convention center . staff was friendly . i asked for , and was given a room with a city view , up high . the room i had was handicap-able , so i think it was a bit different the the rest . the elevators were fast and efficient , the property was clean . N computers are offered in the lobby to print airline documents . the internet in rooms was slow , but useful . not certain if i will be charged for it or not ? my only negative is that there are no in room safes . i called and was told that i could keep my valuables in the safe behind the front desk ? ? odd for a hotel ? ? who wants to wait in a lines to access cash , or personal property ? the red line subway is about a N block walk , safe by day . check out the shark chicken fish takeout restaurant close by , great catfish ! ! 
it ' s conveniently located right next to one of the theaters that ' s playing wicked . so the eccentrically decorated room i had was a bit smaller than it appeared on the hotel site ' s photos . my room did not have a great view , it ' s facing other tall buildings , but it was quiet . it does have modern amenitiy like the flat screen tv , very comfortable bed , toiletries from aveda , and an alarm clock radio that you can hook up your ipod to . the downside is i had trouble finding an outlet to plug my laptop and charge my phone . the closet is very small . this hotel has been around for a while even with it ' s modern amenities , but for some reason i just got the creeps especially when someone told me the hotel was part of the haunted tour . . i didn ' t see anything unusual . overall , it ' s not too shabby . 
every moment of our stay here was wonderful . . . . the staff is very welcoming and helpful , the hotel in every detail is beautiful . . . we loved our stay here ! they have a complimentary driver who will take you anywhere in the city you would like to go , which is a real treat ! the rooms that we had adjoined and were very spacious ( one had a fireplace ) and the bathrooms were gorgeous no detail has been overlooked ! we also used the workout area which is also very well done with great equipment . thank you , elysian for coming to chicago and giving us a world class place to stay . . . we will definately come back . 
this hotel is not really my style . it is very contemporary , but the beds are so very comfortable . . . . so that ' s great . the " living room " about blew my teen kids away . they think that it ' s the bomb . what i have loved so far . . . . . chris the guy out front who helped us bring up our bags . he ' s awesome and friendly . . . . made friends with my son and even called us to tell my son that they were filming the new batman downstairs and that he should come down and watch the filming . that was cool . we got to see " gotham " police dept . cars on the street . apparently , they ' ll be filming all night . i also forgot my computer power cable and jeff , the concierge , called around and helped me find one . that was a godsend . i ' m working on my master ' s thesis and really would have been in bad shape without it . all in all , this is not a great shopping destination hotel , but we ' re easy walking distance to lollapalooza and thus the art museum and theatre district . very comfortable . very nice . p . s . thanks w staff . you ' ve made this a nice experience . 
so many positive reviews of this hotel from people who have never before contributed to tripadvisor ? you can t help but wonder if they re written by never-stay college students for N a pop . so is the elysian that good ? frankly , after our may stay , i would travel back to chicago from australia just to revisit this hotel . we still reminisce about our N night stay at the elysian - a nostalgic conversation prompted this review . fantastic location . despite the rigorous no-tipping policy , the service is extraordinary consistently uber-friendly , helpful and efficient . door staff offer umbrellas at the suggestion of rain , jump to provide the free hotel town car service whenever possible . restaurant staff , noting the presence of a noisy group of diners , quickly offer a table in a quiet corner . the spa delivered the best pedicure of my life . gym staff offer evian water as you rack up your treadmill miles . our premier gold coast suite was subtle and gorgeous , with excellent flat screen tvs , cosy fire-place , fabulous wardrobe space and gi-normous marble bathroom only suggestion for improvement would be outdoor furniture on the terrace . housekeeping was perfect , the bathroom always squeaky clean . great free wi-fi . room service menu was a bit minimalist for my taste . after a delectable mexican dinner at salpicon and hilarity at second city , we stopped by the hotel bar for a night-cap . snug , elegant , romantically dim , with generous yet non-intrusive service we enjoyed excellent cocktails at bernard s bar . ( the next day i unsuccessfully tried to discover the ingredients of mine on the internet i think it contained lavender ? ) absolutely recommend this hotel ! 
i made my reservation at the whitehall hotel on expedia . com . when i arrived , cecelia at the front desk informed me that they had not received any notice of the reservation from expedia . i placed a call and the representative at expedia kept me waiting nearly an hour before he was able to determine that an error in their computer system was causing the e-faxed reservation confirmations to not be sent properly to hotels . cecelia was very patient and helpful . she also upgraded us to a beautiful suite even though the hotel was not at fault . she is a wonderful example of what hospitality really means and i will definitely be returning to the whitehall . 
my fiancee and i booked a room at the knickerbocker and just returned . we had room N , which had a king size bed and a partial view of the beach . this hotel is not as bad as people on this website say it is . i was concerned after reading some reviews , but when we arrived i realized that some people are just way too picky . i didn ' t feel the hotel was " disgusting " as some other reviewers thought . here are some highlights room - the room was decent sized and had a very comfortable king size bed . the decorations are a little weird , but i feel like it adds to the character of this hotel . the bathroom is small , but for one person at a time it is fine . the shower worked really nice and the soaps and shampoos included were good quality . considering how old the hotel is , i feel the rooms are in very good condition . lobby - the lobby is large with a really nice bar attached . the drinks were pricey though at about N for a rum and coke . we didn ' t go to the hotel restaurant , but it looked like it is very reasonably priced . staff - the front desk staff , concierge , and bell hops were all very friendly and accommodating . the concierge even helped us find the address for a bar we were looking for . we had no problems at all . location - absolutely perfect . less than one block from michigan avenue and the hancock building and only about two blocks from water tower place . it is close to the beach too . also , tons of restaurants were within walking distance , including ditka ' s . parking - we parked directly across the street at the parking garage right next to the drake . they charged N per day , but it ' s better than the N per day that the hotel charges . overall , we had a great stay at the knickerbocker and we would stay there again . 
at about N night for N people ( breakfast included ) , this was undeniably an excellent deal . the location is prime , and the room was well-designed and comfortably held our entire family . the free cocktail each evening was nice the nibbles were decent ( an unfortunate sea of styrofoam cups , however ) . however , the much vaunted " cooked to order breakfast " was a chaotic , unpleasant ordeal each morning . we felt like cattle waiting to be served at the trough . there was insufficient seating , and the entire environment reeked of make-shift disposable ( ugly folding tables chairs , ugly plastic trays , and again a miserable waste of styrofoam cups ) . dread of the breakfast pandemonium would cause hesitation in whether to stay at this hotel again . it is a shame , as so much of the hotel has good things to offer . 
unless you don ' t care about service , it is non-existent behind the front desk . i was staying at the hotel felix with my wife and N kids . " can i have adjoining rooms ? " " no sir they are all accounted for . " " ok , can i have a room w two double beds that are near my room ? " " no sir , they are all accounted for . " " i am traveling with N kids , what would you like me to do ? " no reply . all rooms that were left for us were one queen bed and no adjoining rooms . meanwhile it was N pm and this was a very early check in . at this point we decided we could not stay and sat on the couch to discuss our next move . after another few minutes a woman who was also behind the front desk walked over to us and whispered , " i got you a king bed in one room and a queen in another and they are adjoining " " wonderful , we will take it ! ! " the rooms were very clean and small , but that is to be expected in a boutique hotel . when we put the air conditioning on in one of the rooms it made a noise so loud that we couldn ' t hear our tv in the second room . we called down and a maintenance man was sent up . he said the problem was the condenser and there was not much he could do . he spent about N minutes in our room but could not fix it . he left and said he would be back in a few minutes . he came back and said that he could try to reset the unti . he spent another N N hour with us and reset the unit to no avail . " sorry , nothing we can do , but we could switch your room " obviously not , it took long enough to get adjoining rooms . " so the unit cannot be fixed ? " " nope , but i can give you a free movie " great , i have an air conditioner that is so loud that i can ' t hear the tv and for that inconvenience i can have a free movie that i won ' t be able to hear . great ! so my child decides to watch avatar . he blasts the tv in his room and then it is time to go to dinner so he needs to pause the tv . we go to dinner and then come back to the room and he tries to watch his movie again . cannot find it anywhere to resume play . so , the hotel sends up the same maintenance guy . he spends another N N hour with us to try to resume the movie . he cant figure it out . " you will just have to order it again " " ok , will that be complimentary ? " " no , you will have to pay for that " thats all i got . had a fantastic weekend in chicago . stay there all the time . have never had such poor service , which is very surprising giving the amount of competition that exists . 
i loved this hotel . i first stayed in hotel indigo in atlanta , ga , and loved it so i figured i ' d give it another shot . this one did not disappoint . the location is a bit far from downtown , but you ' re right by the l , so it ' s really not bad . the beds are amazingly comfortable , the decor is bright and fresh , the rooms are fairly spacious ( although a small bathroom ) . the service was ok . they were not rude at all , but no overly nice either . i would definitely stay in this hotel again if i were headed back to chicago . ) 
we stayed here for the following reasons N . free chicago parking N . free shuttle to train station at midway N . points per night were N , N on starwood the employees were extremely friendly and cooperative , the shuttle drivers and front desk bent over backwards to give you anything you needed . my basic complaint with the property is that it needs a good makeover . double beds in two bedded rooms are too small for this man and his wife , " we got little or no sleep " . not that we shouldn ' t lose at least N pounds between the two of us , but i do prefer queen beds in two bedded rooms . the room itself was tidy , but needed updating . certainly nothing to keep me away from it . the hvac system was noisy and did not keep the temperature very steady , we spent the night either too hot or too cold -- very little sleep for either of us . the tv didn ' t work most of the time we were there , we would have moved rooms but weren ' t in the room enough to bother with that . two free computers and printers in the lobby to use for guests were very convenient . parking is free here , so we were able to leave our car and use public transportation to get around town at N for a two day transit pass . shuttle service was near immediate every time we needed it . they gave us a number to call when we were approaching the train station to let them know you needed picked up . 
we stayed N nights and were extremely pleased with the accommodations and service we received . we were able to check in N Nam which was a relief ( reg checkin was Npm ) . rooms were fantastic and we were given a great view of the city overlooking the riverwalk . fitness center is great also . one disappointment no pool jacuzzi . 
absolutely awesome hotel ! i had the pleasure at staying at this hotel on short notice . the staff , specifically ms . jackie , and ms . regina provided great service . i flew in from washington , d . c . and my family failed to find a place for me to stay . cslh found a way to help me at the most difficult time . once i got to my room , everything was well laid out , the room was very clean , and you the climate , as well as the freshness of the room was very nice . the attitude of every member of the staff was very friendly and professional . i will certainly comeback to this hotel ! ! you cant beat the price ! this is where you want to sleep tonight . . . trust me ! 
the front desk agents are incredibly helpful , courteous , knowledgeable and truly love what they do . if you get the pleasure to stay here - i would ask for matt by name . he was so helpful to me . he gave me the inside scoop of millennium park and the surrounding area . speaking of the area - it is right on the chicago river , just a nice stroll down ( literally ) to michigan avenue . in between millennium park and the wrigley building . 
very nice hotel , but the bed was pretty hard . large bathroom , big room , huge closet and okey location . . shopping on michigan avenue was walkable . i was there aug , N-N , N and the weather was pleasant enough to walk the magnificent mile . the carpeting on the Nst floor could use some cleaning though . weekend breakfast buffet was N . i ended up having a croissant and coffee in the lobby which was excellent and only N . ordered room service the day i arrived and the pizza was awful . since i was starving and the cost was N , i ate it anyway . staff was very friendly . when i did go to the gift shop , it was closed and the sign said the employee would return in N minutes . . i never went back . overall , this was an okey hotel . i do admit though , it did not meet the expectations of what i have frequently read about fairmont hotels . 
we just returned from a four night stay at the the seneca . i booked this trip through a travelzoo promotion ( N night for deluxe suite ) before i read any trip advisor reviews . since it was a non-refundable rate , there was no turning back . the exterior and interior of the hotel are full of charm and the staff is very polite and helpful . though the elevators are small , they exude the character of the period and were always available when called . we arrived way before check-in and our luggage was safely stored and the hotel staff advised us of the best way to get to our desired locations . our luggage was promptly delivered to our Nth floor room with a hotel provided baby bed upon check-in . the room was a deluxe suite which included a bedroom , bathroom , two walk-in closets , living room , dining area with table for four and full-size kitchen with everything you need if you want to cook . the space was just right for our family of five with the exception of the bathroom . it was very small . the overall decor was extremely dated but everything was clean . the two closets are a waste however , one was so large that it served as bedroom for the baby . there were no black-out curtains in either room , so we were up with the sun . our floor had a very clean , coin operated washer and dryer which ended up coming in handy after a couple of baby accidents . there is a small but efficient gym on the top floor with about N machines and free weights . everyday i was in there , it was being cleaned . there were always fresh towels to use and a full water cooler as well as a flat screen tv . also on the top floor is a beautiful and underused roof deck . i don ' t know if you can see the navy pier fireworks from there but it is worth trying . if i were to travel to chicago again with my family , i would definitely stay here again . the location was perfect , the price was right and we had plenty of space in our room . if i were to go with just my husband , i would probably stay somewhere a little more luxurious . all in all , this was a budget and family friendly hotel . 
had booked the room earlier in the year requesting early check-in . arrived , told room wasn ' t ready . my daughter had to change in the bathroom to attend conference . upon return to the hotel later in the afternoon , the room we were given was double booked . had to wait while they moved that gentleman out and recleaned the room . staff is indifferent . for the price charged for the room , the hotel is quite plain , the inconvenience - never stay here again . willing to pay more for a nicer , more friendly place
we stayed at the hotel allegro when we recently visited chicago to see the musical , wicked . the trendy boutique hotel had been recommended by several friends , and it was miles from ordinary but steps from everything . allegro is located in the theater area and near one of the el stations it was only a block and a half to traverse before making it to the property . friendly bellmen escorted us in , and we ascended the staircase to the second level to check in ( we discovered the nearby elevator later ) . the lobby reminded us of a contemporary mod Ns motif with red velvet couches , oversized midnight blue chairs and modern light fixtures . dark wood covered the walls and was paired with a large , checkerboard carpet in brown and cream . the front desk staff was welcoming , explaining the business center , fitness area that i truly thought we would use and the surrounding areas . this lobby also serves as the locale where free unlimited wine flows during the wine hour , each evening from N-N p . m . the concierge is also located on this floor . visiting hotel allegro marked one of the few times that i have used hotel hair products . all aveda products were available and the small bathroom had a deep bathtub and marble countertops . the hotel itself is updated from an older building , so the rooms are not large according to today s standards . we had enough space , and the rooms were carefully decorated in chocolate and salmon with accents of gold and light green . in an armoire , the expansive mini bar was stocked with a small refrigerator and dry goods area contained anything from red bull to snacks and even hangover remedies . a cd player was available as well . the closet housed an iron and ironing board , but by no means was this closet large , even to the smallest of munchkinlanders . the encore liquid lounge had a groovy feel with upbeat tempos . we appreciated the wicked-themed martinis such as the lollypop kid , making for an even better night of theater . people from all walks ( literally there was a race that weekend ) stopped in for drinks before or after the theater , on the way to dinner or as a nightcap . the bartenders were extremely attentive , even on the busiest nights . food may also be purchased . N chicago is the adjacent , on-site restaurant serving breakfast , lunch and dinner . allegro s amenities stretched from leopard print robes delivered on request to a complimentary yoga basket to use while watching the yoga station on television . we saw plenty of pets during our stay . allegro s pet friendly policy is actually a good one - there is no weight limit and furry creatures can even book their own happy tails hotel package . our only complaint was not even the hotel s fault . a gaggle of teenagers stayed on our floor for a bat mitzvah and did not sleep much during the night , which meant that we had the privilege of enjoying their noise . the walls are definitely thin , although our room on the sixth floor overlooking the el did not have any street noise . the convenient location did prove to be in the middle of everything , even a parade . as we were in chicago during memorial day weekend , the parade was gearing up just as we were leaving our hotel and we were able to enjoy it before moving on to nearby shopping on state street and michigan avenue . we walked to both areas , but michigan avenue might merit a cab ride home , depending on the amount of shopping completed . also nearby is the new millennium park , grant park , the art institute , tons of dining and more . we would definitely go back . it was the perfect complement to a weekend of culture in chicago . 
i stayed here in december of N for a convention at mccormick place . location couldn ' t have been better , never had to walk outside to get to the conference . the room was nice , with a nice view of the lake ( i was on the Nth floor , not facing the city ) . overall , the room was clean , but there were minor things that would have made it better - what appeared to be a coffee stain in the carpet , some mior touchup in the paint in the bathroom . also , the heating was finicky , although it worked fine overall ( blew cool air when it reached temperature instead of shutting off at times ) . the iron looked hardly used , but could have used replacement . the restaurants on site were pretty good , especially liked shor . they a resort-priced , but right on target for what i ' ve seen in chicago price-wise . there is a metra station right next to the hotel , and the N cta train runs right in front ot the hyatt to michigan avenue , so although the location isn ' t necessarily in the heart of downtown , it ' s very accessible with public transportation . the service at the hotel was very good . every staff member i had dealings with treated me very well , and made me feel welcome . i absolutely will stay he again when i return next year . on a final note , the bed at this hotel was among the most comforatble i have ever slept in , including my own bed at home . i highly recommend this place . 
palomar ' s location on state street near illinois is central to all of chicago ' s best . staff here treats you royally from check-in to check-out . our room wasspotless and oversized and the hotel has a rooftop lap pool and state of the art fitness center . an evening social of wine along with delicious flatbreads is served from N to N in a beautiful street level room with horizontal fireplace and cozy chairs and decorative allure . morning coffee and tea is available early each day . one thing i might suggest is a complimentary breakfast along with the coffee since this area is a gathering place and a light bite along with morning coffee would be most appreciated . on anothewr note , palomar ' s restaurant sable has a fine dining reputation whcih we will be sure to check out at our next stay . 
this was our first time at this residence inn and our weekend stay was great . we know the area well . we love all the action in the river north section of town . the room was large with a bedroom , sitting room and kitchen . it was super clean with all the amenities . we had five people in the sitting room for a visit and we could have held N more . the price was very reasonable ( even though chicago rates are getting pretty high ) . a great quality to price ratio . the staff was extremely friendly and helpful without getting " in your face " . we ' ll definitely be back . 
having stayed in a few kimpton hotels , we decided to try the new palomar in chicago for a family weekend . the location is great , a few blocks from michigan ave . , walking distance to theaters and wonderful restaurants . the staff was very friendly and didn ' t not ignore the kids as is the case at many " hip boutique " hotels . they were given goody bags , with colored pencils , yoyos etc . everything needed to keep a " bored " kid busy while waiting for dinner , the yoyos were in constant use on our walks around the city . the room was a true one bedroom suite with ample couch room for the two kids . the bathroom was glorious , one of the largest bathtubs i have ever seen ! as for the restaurant and bar , the bar has one of the best cocktail menus , more of a book , i have ever seen . defining hand crafted . the only meal we eat at the hotel was a breakfast , which was good , but the service was very slow , possibly due to the fact that is was sunday morning at opening time . we would highly recommend this kimpton property , it is now our first choice for weekend getaways in chicago . 
it was not a bad hotel , but i will not ever stay again . i believed the other reviews , and took a chance . though people may have mentioned some good things , there were so many small things that were not good , they all added up . they list a dvd player in each room . when we were put on hold about the missing player , the recording they play as you wait , boasted about the dvd players in each room . we were told the owners got rid of them . they also got rid of the coffee pots ! there are no raised floor bottoms on the shower , so an extra drain is in front of the toilet , for the water . water flows freely all over the bathroom floor under the shower curtain . the tv was on the far right of the room , though the N beds are in the middle . tv was in a little cubby area , not good for viewing . the fridge was so small , it only has enough room for the mini-bar items . if you want to use it , you have to remove all the pay stuff , and have the bar items take up nearly all of the limited counter space . elevators barely held N people and our luggage . no joke . N person max , and no room for luggage with N ! hot elevator temp . smallest lobby i have ever seen . about the size of my great room and kitchen . the main lobby being a great room , and the coffee area like my kitchen . . air conditioning in the lobby and halls were none , or limited . concierge never answered my emails sent N days before my trip . location was good , but there are better at this price . rooms were clean , bedding was great . robes were shown in photos . no robes . no vending machines of any kind . lobby offers free coffee and water . ice only on every other floor . staff was friendly . we had to change rooms . Nst room had a garbage dumpster outside our window , and was old , odd shaped , and poorly arranged . . second room had a nicer view , and was newer . Nnd room also had better tv placement . tvs were flat screen , hd . the channels however , were not hd , so we had to adjust the screen width so we did not have to watch everything stretched . all rooms are not equal . old room had a huge bathroom , huge like a locker room . very odd . . nicer Nnd room had a tiny tiny bathroom , but it did have a ledge to stop the water . it only had a shower door though . . no soap dish in the showers . no hook or ring for a hand towel . no cup in the bathroom . both bathrooms had an odd placement for the bath towels . right above the toilet paper . unless you folded your towels in , they covered the toilet paper . carpet was like kitchen carpet , flat and a little stained , though clean . N rocks glasses at the bar , but no cup to brush your teeth . bathroom scale and remote both needed new batteries . maids were quiet and courteous . other guests were also quiet and courteous . one thing i will list as a deal breaker though , was the air conditioning . in both of our rooms , the air was a dial thermostat . ( a dial like an . am radio ) the air in both rooms was set at N degrees . this is the lowest setting . my guess was it was around N to N degrees in the room , with no way to go lower . not horribly hot , but never refreshingly cool by any measure . they claimed the Nnd room had updated or recently cleaned air vents , filters , etc . . but it was the same . there is no reason whatsoever to choose this hotel over any other . i hope my words have a ring of truth , as i tried to mention good as well as not so good . not bad , just not good . the N dollar a day internet is really too much . many chicago hotels are free internet , and the ones who charge range from N-N dollars . also , you have to get a code every N hours for the internet . we take a trip to chicago every year , for the past N or N yrs . different hotel every time . this is my Nst review of any chicago downtown hotel . i d never been disappointed before . we ve never stayed at the hyatt , or hilton . we always stay at mid-priced chains . our Nst so-called boutique , and our last . 
for me , this is the best location in chicago . you are on state street with a view of the river and can walk within a few minutes to the theater district or michigan ave for some shopping . the service at this hotel is what you would expect for the price - first rate . the rooms are comfortable , nicely decorated , and most offer a good view . from our room we could see the river , the chicago theatre , and the wrigley building . this hotel is pricey , but worth it . on our stay , we were on the Nth floor and had only two problems . first , there were some guests who were a bit loud in the hallway . i called the front desk and security came to quiet them immediately ( both times ) . the hotel can ' t keep guests from being a bit loud while enjoying themselves , but they did all they could to keep them quiet after receiving complaints , so i appreciated that . the second problem was that there were a lot of sirens in the city and we could hear them from our room . i ' ve stayed in chicago many times and have experienced the same problem at all hotels , so there isn ' t anything that can be done about that . just ask for a room as high up as you can get , but even the top floor won ' t keep you from hearing sirens . parking is steep , but there are plenty of self-park garages nearby , so choose one of those to save a few dollars , if you are interested . 
great location , great service , great rooms ! i would definitely stay here again . 
i ' m a chicago native ( tho ' moved away in ' N ) and went " home " for a weekend with my husband to visit friends . this hotel was perfect . the location was great . . . basically dearborn and division . we took the cta for N each from midway airport to the hotel . went smoothly except for a few flights of stairs with luggage . if you ' re a bit adventurous , the cta ' s definitely a value ! the hotel ' s style reminded me of an upscale hotel that you ' d find in a european city . . . rooms are small , but the decorating was " edgy " in a very cool way . granite counter tops in the bathrooms , pergo flooring in the room with an area rug , one wall was covered with huge blueberry wallpaper . ( yes , like someone took a photo of a basket of just-washed blueberries , and blew it up into a wall-sized photograph ! ) linens and bedding were pristine . room was very clean . only drawback was that room was located directly across from the elevator and we could hear folks chattin ' while waiting and the " ding " when the elevator arrived . staff was friendly and helpful , phone system was easy to use ( voice mail wake up calls ) . we did not eat there . ( hotel has a limited breakfast menu , but what they had looked appetizing and the seating area looked clean and , again , had that cool decorating thing goin ' on . ) had breakfast a few doors down at Nrd coast cafe--also highly recommend the selection there is more of a bacon eggs , bigger breakfast type thing . " mother ' s " ( a fairly well-known bar ) was around the corner . lots of fun . . . sang ' til N Nam with the rest of the folks at the bar . crowd was about N years younger than we were , but they didn ' t seemed bothered by us old folks ( we ' re in our forties ) . the wait staff there was pleasant , even at that hour , and since mother ' s had only popcorn to eat , our waitress suggested we run across the street , pick up a pizza and bring it back in ! we had a ball . . . 
my wife and i needed a hotel downtown to stay at while we celebrated our N year anniversary . we stayed downtown on our wedding night , so we wanted to stay downtown again . but it was the week of a huge music festival and prices were skyhigh . so we searched and found a great price online for the whitehall . we knew nothing about it , but looked it up on tripadvisor ( as we always do ) . many people had good , and some bad things to say about the hotel . . . but our experience was all good . first , great location . blocks away from the hancock building , shopping , great food . . . and everything is in walking distance . second , the hotel is classically beautiful and clean . finally , they treated us well . we had a problem with our air conditioner , they fixed it quickly . when they found out it was our anniversary , they upgraded us . we were thrilled with our whole experience and would recomend it highly . 
i always enjoy staying at this hotel in the heart of chicago ' s magnificent mile for business . i have stayed here a few times and just have to write to say i hate that small bathroom ! the door is in the way and the tissue ( this time around ) was not a hook , just placed on the bathroom lid ! mind you , that is probably not the best place for it . otherwise , the hotel was fine . 
our son ' s entry into the chicago marathon presented the opportunity for a short visit to chicago . a four day reservation was arranged cheerfully and without difficulty . our arrival through o ' hare international two days prior to the marathon gave adequate time to settle-in and to gain a perspective on hotel facilities and navigation around the city . catching the train from o ' hare delivered us within three blocks from our hotel . the hotel proved to be an ideal location as a launch pad for touring the city and for short foot-bound excursions to many nearby attractions . the hotel is within blocks of ground transportation and was a short distance to many critical waypoints along the marathon route . when coming " home " to the hotel we always received a friendly and courteous greeting from the hotel staff . room service was equally cordial and helpful . the rooms were spacious and sparkling clean . the hotel ' s breakfast buffets were great as were the extended facilities . we would recommend this hotel to family and friends and will return at our earliest convenience . 
we made our reservation using priceline name your price and save N . N off the expedia rate . the hotel is very convenient to the attractions we wanted to see . it sits right on the chicago river and if you get a room on the north end of the west tower you will have a great view of the chicago river and lake michigan . houllihan ' s restaurant is one block to the west and has a great breakfast bar that is considerably less than the hotel restaurant . the staff are friendly , the room was quiet , the bed was great and we slept well . buy your own water from the N-eleven store N blocks west . the bottled water in the room is very expensive . don ' t open the refrigerator unless you want to be charged for using it . 
my wife and i stayed here for one night and also used the spa services . i got a deep tissue massage which was awesome , my wife got a facial . the place was very clean and the staff was pleasant and accommodating . the hotel itself is very hip , it has a real club feel . the first floor bar and second floor lobby have a good layout , great decoration and in the evening they are comfortably crowded with a nice atmosphere . the rooms are unique but very comfortable . great view out the floor to ceiling window and you can tell that everything is new . quick note on the shower it shares a wall glass window with the room . the glass is covered with a curtain , but if you want to you can open the curtain from the room to have a full view of the shower in use . pretty fun . overall , this place is awesome and a great place for chicago . 
just stayed here again for vacation . another great stay . the room was a great size . love having a coffee maker , microwave refrigerator in the room , with trader joe ' s next door this can save you lots . the staff was always pleasant and very helpful . it is a great location just one block off the magnificent mile . will always stay here for pleasure or business when in town . just great location and value for the cost . 
i stayed at the fairmont in august N . it ' s a bit far away to write this review but i thought i would drop a line since i had a great experience . we booked through expedia . ca . i had written a comment to ask if we could get an upgrade since this is a special trip . i went with my aunt who had never travelled outside of toronto since she moved from hk N years ago and it was her first time taking the plane and visiting the us . the hotel gave us a big suite with N separate beds and we had a beautiful view . we stayed here for N nights and the service is fantastic . we forgot our slippers and called room service late at night and they came very quickly . the rooms are what you see on the website ' s pictures . and the hotel is very generous with the toiletries like shower cap , soap , shampoo , conditioner , shoe mit . if you need toothpaste , they will also bring it up . only downside is it ' s a bit of a walk to magnificent mile - a good N minutes . it ' s windy and very sunny so be sure to bring a scarf a light jacket at night . but it ' s close to the millenium park and the bean . there ' s a grocery store close to the hotel so we grabbed some snacks there . we also walked almost everywhere but took a cab to a nice restaurant further away . i highly recommend this hotel , the staff at the front desk are nice , accommodating and there ' s no attitude or snottiness . i booked early so i think you should do that if you want to secure a good price . we had a room on a high floor and never heard any noise from the the rooms next door . we didn ' t eat at the hotel restaurants and preferred venturing to cafes on magnificent mile and other streets in that area . 
stayed N nights in april . our room was very nice and newly renovated . six lifts so no long wait , you had to have a room key to use the lift after N . Npm . very large hotel so staff appeared not to be aware what was going on expect in there own area , front desk staff could not tell me opening hours for the bars or restaurants . as it is such a big hotel it has no atmosphere . booked this hotel on hotwire so got a bit of value would have been disappointed if i had paid full price . 
first time in chicago . . . stuck with one of our favourite hilton chains and we were not disappointed . very well priced . great location . walking distance to the theatre we were attending . close to three transit lines and a couple stops to shopping during the day and blues clubs at night . the rooms were well decorated , laid out and quite comfortable . what we have come to expect from a hampton . 
we just got home from a weekend at the palmer house-what a wonderful experience ! not only was it a beautiful hotel but everyone was so accomodating and friendly ! ! i will definetly stay there again ! ! 
stayed here for N nights . good location , near to the mag . mile . very large hotel with typical service ( both good and bad ) that you would expect . long wait for check-in - the three people on the desk kept disappearing for long periods behind a screen ! lady on the concierge was not very friendly ( as i see others have noted ) , and looked surprised that i wanted to know how to get to the art institute . worst thing was the sound insulation in the rooms . i had two connecting doors , and could hear everything from next door -conversations , toilet , television - well , i mean everything ! had to sleep with ear plugs in ! when will hotels learn that , if they have rooms with connecting doors , these should at least be insulated properly when not in use eg with padding or a sound-proof cover . i paid almost N per night , but it was like staying in a N star motel . no chance to move room as the hotel was completely full . apart from that it was ok - but the maid did keep knocking on the door , despite the fact that i had a do not disturb card on the door ! also , the soap in the shower gave me a rash ! i think there are better hotels in chicago for these prices . 
the raffaello is in a great location for spending a few days in chicago shopping and sightseeing . we self-parked our car at the garage across the street for N per day and left it there the entire time . great shopping and restaurants all within walking distance . the hotel itself is in a fairly quiet location . we had a double room which was pretty spacious for a downtown hotel . the beds were very comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean . the front desk staff was not very friendly , but the bell captains were always polite and helpful . we booked a N-night special through the hotel website for N per night which i would say was a great value for this convenient , updated hotel . 
the w lakeshore hotel is a great place to stay hands down ! ! i traveled solo on a business trip from new york and the treatment from when i walked into the " living room " to when i checked in was superb . the whatever whenever experience was executed to a t . whenever i requested a toothbrush , shaving kit and even floss , the young lady raquel brought it up to me with a smile . she was very kind and always used her name and never ceased to let me know if i needed anything else to let her know . i felt like i was bothering her at times but she didnt mind at all . . w lakeshore crew , you guys rock ! ! ! 
i have spend two separate weeks at this property recently , once during the month of january and once during february . this property is quite large though their staffing seems to have been greatly reduced . the concierge desk was never manned . i never saw more than two staffmembers at the front desk . the rooms are quite dated but are of a standard size and adequately maintained . the animal print wallpaper is peeling at spots and the furniture in the rooms is showing more than average wear and tear . the location of this property is just north of the chicago river and one block east of michigan avenue . the loop and the magnificent mile are within easy walking distance . the airport is easily accessed by cathing the N busline ( directly behind the pj clarke ' s restaurant in front of the hotel ) which will take you to milwaukee where you can catch the blue line to o ' hare . chicago ' s buses are equipped with visual and auditory indications for each stop . there are several excellent restaurants within walking distance of this hotel . transportation is excellent with a cta ( chicago transit authority ) N-day pass available for N . you can purchase this pass at the blue line station at o ' hare . beware if you are looking for dinner after a day of business meetings you will be hard set to find any restaurants open after Npm ! 
i stayed at this hotel when doing business at an office on the magnificent mile . the hotel was very functional . . . free wifi was a plus . . . and the adjoining starbucks was very convenient . i ordered room service one evening which took a very long time to arrive , but the next morning i had a note of apology under my door with a gift certificate for a free starbucks coffee . the room service food , though , was very good . i went out for a run one afternoon and found it easy to run down to millenium park and back in about N minutes . the last time i was doing business in this location , i stayed at the w hotel near the lake . it is obviously difficult to compare the two hotels , but i would stay at the courtyard again next time just for its basic good service , convenience , and functionality . 
a group of us stayed at the w lakeshore for a weekend for my sister ' s bachelorette party . we chose the package deal which was supposed to include a luxury suite for the bride and N friends , limo transportation to and from the clubs , and special vip treatement at le passage . instead , we got a suite with one king bed ( for N people ) , a bus , and the bouncers at le passage acted as though they had no idea what we were talking about . so obviously i ' d never recommend the bachelorette package . in addition , checking in took forever , the staff was unfriendly and rude , and the hotel decor is overrated . the only thing we liked about our stay were the bliss products in the bathroom ! 
this is the first time i stayed at the wyndham blake hotel . the common areas are uninspiring but the rooms are very large and nice . there are many drawers for storage in the rooms and in the bathrooms . my bathroom was also larger than an average hotel bathroom and and nicely decorated . the view out the window was a brick wall but i didn ' t get the room for the view . i wish i had tried the breakfast but i didn ' t . i had to get to work too early . the breakfast opens about N am . there is a restaurant that is attached and next door . it is pricey and not a place for a quick dinner on a business trip . it is more of a date-night-out restaurant . the door man , and the rest of the staff , were very helpful . overall , i liked the hotel and would recommend it to others if you need to be in the area . 
beautiful , modern rooms--a view provided based on request at check-in . fantastic concierge service--these people really love know the city--recommended things with knowlege and zeal plus there are N-N available at a time . no pool but rumor has it , you can swim somewhere nearby . gracious and accomodating staff , perfect location--be forewarned ( and the woman checking us in did tell us ) that their mini-bar is on a sensor system and if you move anything--you will be charged . 
we stayed at the seneca easter weekend N . we had a great time and really enjoyed the hotel . the people who worked there were friendly and very helpful with restaurants and bus schedules . we would stay there again and not think twice about it . our room was nice and big and clean . the tv worked just fine . didn ' t use the kitchen but there seemed to be plenty of dishes , pans and silverware . maybe the people who had a problem with the staff had an attitude of there own . we found the staff to be very friendly and helpful . we ate in the restaurant upstairs and had a super meal . the hotel is right off of michigan ave , where you can walk everywhere you want to go . 
came from las vegas to chicago for a family wedding . the hotel was beautiful , staff was great very helpful . beds were the best i have ever had in a hotel room . hotel was in great location walking distance to everything . staff was top notch very helpful . 
great hotel - great room size . concierge was very helpful . overall wonderful experience ! 
if it weren ' t for the location there would be nothing about this hotel that was positive . the room was slightly larger than a walk in closet and stunk like a moldy basement . the bathroom door had a broken hinge and couldn ' t close . the toilet didn ' t want to flush . the tv reception was terrible . there were cigarette butts all over the window ledge in this non smoking room . the shower was a joke . . no pressure and tepid water temp . the shower curtain was too short so water got everywhere . the floors looked dirty and the paint on the woodwork was all chipped . the hallway smelled worse than the room and needed repairs to the walls and baseboards . there were picketers outside who kept blowing loud shrill whistles as they picketed . it took the valet over N N hour to get our car for us from the parking lot just around the corner . if we could have found another hotel we would have ran as fast as we could from this one . all in all , the worse hotel experience we ever had . and all this at a N-N star price , what a rip off . 
my business partner and i travel to chicago every year for a convention . last year we stayed at the ritz carlton and it was very nice , if not a bit stodgy . we had walked by the sofitel and i thought i ' d give it a try . the hotel is very modern and beautiful . even though i ' m N years old now , i can at least pretend that i am young and hip . we booked N junior suites for about the same as we would ' ve paid at the ritz . my partner got a awesome corner room . i ended up in a ' disabled ' junior suite . while i would ' ve preferred my partner ' s room , my room was still very nice . being that it was for disabled guests it had N seperate showers and a seperate tub in the bathroom . it also had these really cool automatic curtains that my partner ' s room didn ' t have . anyway , stil a really cool room . there are two bars downstairs both pouring great french champagne by the glass . we ordered room service a couple of times and it was excellent . i highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again . 
i left the raffaello in late november after a very pleasant ( as always ) two-night stay . but i forgot my bag , including laptop etc . , in the garage across the street when i was packing the car to depart . didn ' t notice until i was back home . i called the hotel . staff were very helpful . a valet ran across the street and retrieved my bag . i talked to the sunday manager who arranged to have my bag shipped to me the next day . i ' ve always liked the raffaello . now i ' m a bigger fan than ever . 
the rooms in this hotel are very large and luxurious . the entryway allows one to enter without people in the hallway seeing much of the room , so there is more privacy than most hotel rooms . the closet opens from two sides - one from the bedroom and one from the bathroom . the shower and tub are located behind a glass door in the bathroom , there is a double vanity sink , and the toilet is in its own separate room . toothpaste and a toothbrush , as well as the typical amenities , are provided for free . my only negative comment about the room is that the two beds were small . there is a lap pool with several lanes and boards and fins . this is a great hotel for those looking for luxury and are willing to pay for it . 
we enjoyed our stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago . upon arrival we were treated with great hospitality . the desk staff was friendly and took the time to visit with us about our room and its pros and what she thought might be a con - the size . our room was small , but was beautiful and very comfortable . we had a great view of the lake . the furnishing seemed expensive and unique . they decor was fabulous and the bed was delightfully comfortable with great linens . the room was very clean upon arrival and was always cleaned with perfection each day we returned from our adventures throughout the city . the hotel as a whole seemed like we stepped back in time . i loved the boutique feel from the mirrored elevators , rotary style phone in the hallway to the old mail slots . we would definitely stay here again ! we loved chicago and this hotel . 
my husband and i stayed at the amalfi for N nights in july . front desk staff are amazing , very helpful . we loved the fact that breakfast is served on each floor very convenient . however , the " happy hour " or " manager ' s reception " each evening was the highlight of our stay at the amalfi . great drinks , tasty appetizers and a great way to mingle with other guests . i would stay here again and have recommended it to a number of our friends . 
our party of three stayed four nights at the comfort suites over a long weekend . the hotel couldn ' t be better located for a leisure trip to chicago just a short walk to the museums , the loop , and to shopping dining on the michigan avenue . the lobby is small if you ' re used to the fancier hotels downtown , but the rooms are larger in comparison to those we ' ve had in other downtown hotels on earlier chicago visits . we had booked a N queen suite , but were upgraded on arrival to a huge N bedroom , N bath suite ( if you ' re reading this comfort suites , thanks again ) . the room was clean but the furnishings were dated and due for upgrades and new carpet . we noted a leak at the toilet which was quickly repaired on the day we notified the front desk . the front desk was very attentive and responded quickly to any request we made . the room had a full kitchen , which we used for dinner comfortably one evening after a trip to trader joe ' s a few blocks away . our biggest pet peeves were noise and wifi access . you expect outside noise in a city like chicago , but most of the noise was internal from the a c system or from the appliances in the kitchen area . we did find that it became white noise quickly and it didn ' t keep me from comfortable sleep . however , if you ' re a light sleeper it could be an issue , especially in the front bedroom which is separated from the kitchen by an open doorway with no door . wifi is provided but for most of our stay the connection ranged from barely usable to not worth trying . breakfast was the average budget hotel quality and the hot options were lower quality than what we ' re used to . it ' s ok if you want cereal , but we found ourselves across michigan avenue at cafe decartes for excellent coffee and pastries . despite our peeves , i considered the comfort suites a great value considering that it was by far the lowest cost option for downtown chicago for a room that could house three adults comfortably . we weren ' t expecting the ritz , and the location was great and the staff as attentive and helpful as we ' ve had at much fancier hotels . 
we enjoyed this hotel this winter . the location is magnificent , N blocks from the michigan ave . , less than N meters to the red line mta train that takes you virtually everywhere . nice view ( floor N ) . the pool is very good and also the business center ( complimentary use of pc and printer ) . within the hotel there is free wifi . 
i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel ! yes , the mini-bar and rendez-vous terrace drinks are way expensive , but given the high-end nature of this hotel , not overpriced . beautiful room , bathroom , tv , comfy bed , central location , etc . i could go on ! i would definately stay here again . staff were friendly and heplful as well . 
the location is very convenient . if you are coming from the airport the blue line stops right outside of the hotel . the rooms are very clean and are kept that way each day by the housekeeping staff . the hotel is close to all chicago ' s important sites and has some great restaurants in the area . the staff is friendly and helpful . my only complaint is that breakfast is served in the small lobby so if there are a lot of guests there at the same time it can get a bit hectic . there are N computers and a printer in the lobby which was very convenient . very reasonable prices for the location and rooms . i ' ll definitely be staying there on my next trip to chicago ! 
we stayed at the ohio house last weekend on a three day stay in chicago . being a fairly expensive city , budget accomodation was something we needed and the ohio house provided . the ohio house is located close to the heart of the city ( a few blocks back from michigan avenue ) . the rooms are small to average size bathrooms average hotel size , with very N ' s style appearence and decor . most people tend to assume that budget accomodation in an expensive city means hygiene problems , however the ohio house , we found to be , was extremely clean ( N stars in that department ) . the motel also has its own small coffee house where we had breakfast on one of our days there . its was nice , but again very N ' s style which was interesting . chicago is full of delicious resturants and cafes though - my personal recommendation is a little french style cafe ' cosi ' , a block or so back from michigan avenue ) . the ohio house is also directly across the road from a large mcdonald ' s ( not that you ' d go all the way to chicago just to eat mcdonald ' s ! ) there was only one issue we had with the ohio house and that was the noise from the streets at night . but the ohio house is a very clean , comfortable stay for anyone wishing to take a budget holiday in chicago - which was a beautiful city . personally , i would stay there again if i was looking for budget accomodation - but should there be available funds , i would probably choose to stay in one of the larger hotels in the city . 
what i loved stayed in the historic building ( the hotel is two buildings conjoined - one old , one new ) and our room was large and lovely . bathroom had both a tub and a shower . beds were lovely with that " sheet on the outside of the blanket and inside of the blanket " thing going on , which is so nice . pillows very comfortable . we loved loved loved the " eno " wine bar downstairs - they do cheese , chocolate and wine only - how neat is that ? we tasted a different flight each night we were there . hotel is close to almost everything - just a couple blocks away from the river to catch the architecture tour on the millenium mile for great shopping , easy walking distance from the red line , easy walking distance from fantastic restaurants ( we went to frontera grill and cafe grand lux ) . annoyances couldn ' t properly open the curtains to let light in the hotel room . gym and computer usage were extra and pricey ( altho i sprang for the gym and it was very well stocked with equipment ) . pool area was beautiful - tho not quite as lovely as swisshotel - where the pool has the best view in the city . overall , would give swisshotel the nod for their more beautiful view of the lake , but this hotel was still quite ideal . 
the hotel burnham is a great spot in chicago ' s theatre district and near many downtown tourist attractions ( e . g . sears tower , chicago theatre , etc . ) . some of the more unique features of the hotel include an old style elevator with gate and the use of keys to open your room . . . yes , real keys ( not cards ) ! the rooms are small , but very tastefully done , with a beautiful poster bed and canopy . the windows are decorated with velvet like curtains with musical scores by mozart in gold colored script , to emphasize the hotel ' s proximity to various performing arts venues . each evening , the hotel hosts a wine reception in the lobby , which is a nice respite after a long workday . the breakfast menu is also quite enjoyable , especially the delicious eggs benedict and fresh squeezed orange juice . i only spent two nights here , but would be happy to come back ! 
my family and i scored a great rate of N a night for the sheraton for a quick weekend trip to chicago . the hotel is in a good location and even though it was february , we were still able to walk to michigan ave . fairly easily from the hotel . check-in was quick and easy . the lobby is beautiful and definitely makes the hotel look like a N-star but that ' s about where the stars start to fade . the elevators are clean and quick . our rooms were on the Nth floor . there were newspapers and food trays strewn about the hallway as we arrived and they were not removed until the following day . the rooms were reasonably clean with the exception of a piece of candy on our floor , a large iron burn mark on the middle of the bedspread and some mold on the shower head . these are things that are easy to overlook in a N or N star hotel but i think it is unacceptable in a N-star hotel . the rooms are good size and the beds are comfortable with decent linens . the toiletries are higher end and made the shower more enjoyable . the mini-bar is an absolute joke as the prices are ridiculous . a bottle of water was N . N ! my parents ate in the breakfast restaurant and said the food was fresh and pretty good . we were only at the hotel for a few nights but it suited our needs . i don ' t think i would stay at this hotel if i had to pay full price for a room but i would definitely stay here again for N or less . 
we came from gatineau and stayed for N days at the indigo in beginning of october . it was very nice . thanks to tom and the lovely staff over there . we had a wonderful time ! 
i was surprised and very disappointed with the bad service here . westin hotels are usually pretty good but this was not the case here . i only stayed N night and had quite a few problems . some were small ( but irritating ) and good hotels always pay attention to the small details . that was not the case here . for example ( N ) room service lunch - they included bread rolls but not enough butter ( N ) room service dinner - it took N mins to arrive and they sent the wrong order . since it was after N . Npm the kitchen was then closed . i was put on hold for N minutes and then told i could order from a local italian take-out ( they would pay ) . an ok response i guess but by then it was near midnight and i would have to wait again for the food . ( N ) the room only had N dim lights and was very dark . i called " service express " to get an additional light sent to the room . i had to call them N times before anyone delivered a light ( despite being told during the first N calls that it was coming ) . this took at least N hours . i will not stay here again . i have stayed at the sofitel before and should have gone back there - it was awesome . 
a friend and i stayed here for N nights . as it was our first time in chicago , we wanted something with easy access to shopping , lots of things to do and places to eat . the allerton did not disappoint . we were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to do ( parks , navy pier , shopping , restaurants , etc ) . we did have to take a bus to bucktown , but the stop was right near the hotel . the staff were friendly , though we didn ' t interact with them too much . the room was in good condition and clean , but the layout was awkward , not allowing the person on the far side of the bed much room to walk to their side ( less than a foot ) . as two girls , we didn ' t mind sharing one bed , but it was hard to get around without disturbing one an other . we were very impressed with the fitness center . there are several cardio machines ( bikes , elliptical , N treadmills ) each with their own tv screen and weight machines free weights . it was clean and there were always plenty of towels . it is bright and airy and wasn ' t overly crowded when we were there . the restaurant in the hotel was ok . it had good food , but not really a good place to have a ' night out . ' overall , we would happily stay at the allerton again it was the best value for us . 
i am no great fan of big city hotels . i prefer a nice comfort inn with free parking and breakfast . but each year i go to chicago during midwest music clinic with my kids to baby sit and help out . this year we stayed at the sheraton and i really enjoyed it . the staff was friendly and the room was beautiful , with a nice view . i made friends with the housekeeper on our floor the first day and never lacked for plenty of whatever i needed . the pool is free , although i had been confused when i read that the fitness center charged . corporate messed up my sons reservations just about every way they could , including charging for days not reserved . it was a mess , but when we arrived everything was fine . i did not eat in the hotel or use room service . on the nights i stayed in to babysit , i grabbed food from dominicks and fox and obels . this hotel is close to lots of things . a great location . 
the downtown chicago fairfield inn is a hidden gem in chicago ' s downtown . located on a tree lined street one block from the magnificent mile and N minute walk to the lake , we felt we were in a quiet hidden neighborhood in the city . the hotel is very clean , nicely decorated with a modern decor and the staff is exceptionally helpful . the suite with the living room ( pullout sofa ) , minifridge and microwave make longer stays very comfortable and would work well for families with children . 
i stayed for just one nite at the sheraton hotel and towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other ta posters but i was not let down . i got the room via pl N and was first placed in a room on the Nth floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot . since i had nothing to lose , i asked to be moved to a " room with a view " . the front desk attendant ( rasheeda ) wanted to make sure that the room i had at first was clean and was in order and i assured her that it was . she then moved me up to the Nth floor with ease and it took about N minute . i was quite surprised as i have heard that they treat pl and hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers . the new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the navy pier , a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of lake michigan . all this for N ? yep ! i skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious ! the room was comfy , had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location . i didnt use it since i wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk . the bed and pillows were very comfy , but i awoke at about N in the morning sweating from the comfy but very warm and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed . this was a great deal for the price and i would absolutely stay here again . 
my stay at the hard rock hotel was a delight . i usually try to avoid business travel because i don t get a good night sleep . this experience with you was superb ! my good night sleep helped me to enjoy the whole experience of being in chicago and attending our conference . the hotel was very interesting , exciting and so pleasant . what wonderful workers you have there . there is a real comfortable ambience about the whole hotel . thank you , thank you for a memorable experience . i intend to return not just for business but also for pleasure ! sincerely , connie chestnut cmsw alzheimer s association of southeastern wisconsin
my husband and i stayed at the hyatt recently and had a great experience . staff was friendly and helpful , rooms were updated , roomy , and very clean . the location downtown to resturants , shopping and attractions was great . to address some of the cons listed by other reviews . . the hotel is large and , as would be expected , the lobby is full of activity , including the great lobby bar that looks out over the city . yes , there is a disco club atmosphere at night but if you looked at the hotel ' s website before you booked you know exactly what you are getting . the dance club didn ' t get started until later evening when kids shouldn ' t be out anyway . we were informed in advance that if you enter the minibar a sensor is set off so there would be a charge . the parking at N a day is very average as anyone who stays in a big city would know and it was quite easy for us to get our car when we needed it without any long waits . there were also complaints listed about the hot water and towels--the water was always hot even when showering during the busy morning hours and the towels were more than adequate . we have traveled all over the world and this hyatt is a great choice for fun weekend in chicago . 
the location is great if you plan on doing a lot of running around chicago . it ' s walking distance to both lake el stations which means you have every el line close by and a straight ride from o ' hare for N . N . the lobby is large and a nice place to meet and hang out . they have N pay computers to use . i have some status and got probably the best room location , a river view at the end of the hall . the room looked like housekeeping had cleaned it in a hurry , the drawers were all open and a couple of spots needed a sweeping though . the room was a bit larger than normal and the bathroom was large . between the wide bathtub and curved shower curtain rod i felt like i was showering in a wet room . sheets and towels were of good quality as was everything else . everything else was westin nominal . definately recommend ! 
stayed here for a few days for work . the location is great on ohio between michigan and st clair , right off mag mile . there is no room service , and the elevators are inconsistent as they lights and indicators don ' t always work . the bathrooms are a little older and the window ac units are a little loud . however the rooms are clean and the service was very nice and friendly . 
this hotel was recommended by friends and it was absolutely spot on the location is great , one block at away from the magnificent mile , just off the john hancock tower and within walking distance of all major shopping . the room was large and clean , with a small kitchenette and a very clean , but relatively small bathroom . just the thing you need for a ( long ) weekend in chicago ! 
i spent a week in the chicago area and had two separate stays at the palmer house . ( spent a night in oak park for a wedding ) the first stay was disappointing but the second made up for it . the first time my boyfriend and i arrived at the hotel we were not offered any help with our luggage . i had three heavy bags and was clearly struggling . the staff was standing around in front of the door but no one could actually open it . it was very windy and the doors were heavy and the effort to open the door made me drop my suitcases . for the age of the hotel the room size was generous . the only problem was that the room was dirty . the dresser was sticky and one of the decorative pillows had a stain on it . the concierge was rude but the dinner recommendation she gave was good . the second time i arrived at the hotel valet immediately greeted us , the bellmen helped with the baggage and there was someone to open the door . my party arrived at Nam , but were able to check in early . ( the rooms weren ' t on the same floor but we opted not to wait for closer rooms . ) my boyfriend and i received an e-standby upgrade so for an additional N a night we got a huge room . there was a dining room , wet bar , large living room , two flat screen tvs , and one and a half baths . we had dinner in lockwood one night and it was pretty good . they had run out of the sparkling wine i wanted but there were plenty of other options . overall my biggest disappointment was the gift shop ( which i think was operated by an independent group . . . ) the hotel has such a rich history and a beautiful logo but there weren ' t any souvenir options that reflected this . the only hotel specific items were one out dated postcard and a tee shirt . the picture on the post card did not show the current furnishings and decor of the lobby and the shirt was very plain and over priced . i would have liked a hotel magnet or something with the peacock logo . 
i stayed at the burnham for a recent business trip to chicago . from the time i checked in , till the time i checked out the staff could not have been more accomodating . the hotel is located right across the street from macy ' s on state street and N N N blks from the el . i took the train from midway and it was a short walk to the hotel . the room was small , but well appointed . appreciated the in-room controls for air and heat . room service was able to accomodate my request for something " not on the menu " . definitely made my trip very enjoyable . 
had to go to chicago and stayed at the drake . the hotel itself was really beautiful and what you would imagine a grand hotel would be like . our room faced the water which was very nice . good size and clean . obviously the location cannot be beat-you ' re close to everything ! concierge friendly and made us dinner reservations . it ' s not super deluxe but there is a distinct charm that cannot be replicated in some of the newer , more modern or fancier hotels in chicago . loved that chanel was located in the hotel ! 
we loved this hotel and would definitely come back . initially we weren ' t given a goldfish , which was disappointing , but then we left a tip for the housekeeper , and she rewarded us with one . we had fun sipping wine and playing wii in the lobby every afternoon . the staff were quite friendly and helpful , even printing our boarding passes for us . our room was very comfortable , with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper . at first we were worried about noise , since our room was next to the elevator , but we hardly heard it , and didn ' t notice any street noise either . the hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated , well-lit , and ideally located . 
i was able to stay at the w hotel lakeshore with a family member that had a comp stay for a business trip . the hotel is located in front of lake michigan off chicago ' s famous scenic lake shore drive . the hotel room was very modern and hip and beds were comfortable . . the bathroom looked really cool . . . but wasn ' t very practical . it was dark so it was tough to see clearly in the mirrors . there wasn ' t much sink space , the shower was a bit tricky and there were slotted doors and windows connecting the bathroom to the bed area so you could hear everything . the view on the other hand was spectacular . it looked right onto lake michigan and navy pier . the hallways leading to the rooms reminded us off decor taken from tlc ' s trading spaces with smooth pebble stones bordering the walls floor . we didn ' t take advantage of the fitness or pool area nor the restaurants , but there is a great ( but expensive bar ) on the roof ( whiskey room ) ) with one of the best views of chicago at night . and there is a trendy bar on the first floor off the lobby that caters to the hip after work crowd . the location is a bit out of the way but walking distance to michigan avenue shopping restaurants and the john hancock building . the doorman can easily get taxi ' s there as well . it is also pretty close cab ride to navy pier and to the amc river east N movie theater . so overall , if you are looking for a trend setting hip place thats a little pricey but has a great view this would be a place to go . 
i have stayed here N times in the past N days and i have been thoroughly impressed with the property and staff . everyone is friendly , professional , and helpful . yes , things can and do wrong from time to time - it would be foolish to think otherwise . however , it is how the staff handle the situation or problem is what counts , and this staff always step up to the plate , apologize ( even if it is not their fault ) and immediately begin to resolve it . the hotel is in a great location , about a block from michigan ave ( major shopping ) and very easy walks to subway metro , as well as state street , rush st , and other sights . the rooms are immaculate , clean , and well maintained . i never had a problem at all in their area and have always been happy sleeping on these amazing beds ! the wifi is reasonably priced , but there are plenty of free hot spots within walking distance . i am a little sad that they do not have a pool - probably , my single downside with this hyatt . prices fluctuate a lot so check often . i have scored rooms between N- N . the area is safe , walkable , and family friendly ! 
the fairmont hotel in chicago has the best value for a weekend in chicago . it is a great location . just south of the mag mile , and just north of millenium park . i took my wife for her birthday and we arrive mid-friday afternoon . we were very courteously greeted by the doorman , escorted by the bell hop to the front desk . he waited while we checked in and then delivered our bags to our room while we retreated directly to the bar for a relaxing " happy hour " . they had some very nice light snacks on the menu there . the hotel is not the most up to date , but the room was very nice and clean , with a very comfortable bed . we walked north for dinner in the evening . in the morning they had an excellent selection of pastries and fruit in the atrium for reasonable prices , plus fresh oj and coffee . i liked that much better than the room service option because you could pick out exactly what you wanted . after a late checkout we took a nice walk through millenium park and the art intitute before heading home . this was our Nnd stay the the chicago fairmont and we it will continue to be our choice for downtown chicago . we have also stayed at other fairmonts and found them to be excellent as well . 
the w hotel greets you with glitter , glamour , and warmth . there is plentiful help right at the door . inside , the lobby is a work of art married with hospitality . concierge service always available right there . the room we stayed in had a wonderful view , great decore , and was very comfortable . the bathroom was something i had never seen before . the fixtures were the latest design , and there was plenty of mirror and counter space . the walls of the bathroom were woven wood , and there was an opening with shutters so you could see out and watch tv while shaving , perhaps . soundproof it was not , making it easy to carry on a conversation with the door slid shut , but not so easy to cover noises you might not want to carry out into the room . there is a super gift boutique just off the lobby with elegant cosmetics and fashions . staying at the w was a memorable experience . the memory still makes me smile . 
what a great find ! inexpensive ( compared to most downtown chicago hotels ) , convenient location , and a great room . i have read other reviews that complained about the size of the rooms my room was perfectly big enough for me and would have been fine for two . the bed was great , comfortable , the room very elegant and servicable . small but very well-appointed bathroom with a huge shower . plenty of storage throughout room . room and entire hotel was clean , clean , clean . great eatery attached ( english pub ) with great wait-staff , or you can order in and have food delivered . valet parking reasonable and convenient ( and pleasant attendants ) . the hotel was full of students that night , but my room was N quiet . as a very frequent traveler i highly recommend this hotel . happy travels ! 
i stayed here while attending a conference at the marriott across the street . this was cheaper and more comfortable . as other reviewers have noted , this is a gem of a hotel . it ' s a true suite , with living room , full kitchen , and bedroom . the living room has a sofabed , sitting chair , coffee table and N " lcd tv . there is a small dining table desk next to the kitchen . the kitchen has microwave , two burner oven , dishwasher , coffee maker , fridge . also plates , pots pans and silverware . the room was clean and comfortable with no obvious signs of wear . the king size bed was also comfy , though not as high end as you would find in a nicer hotel . there is a regular tube tv in the bedroom . the free buffet breakfast had scrambled eggs , meats , cereal , make your own waffles , etc . there is also a dinner with a different menu mon-thurs but i did not have that . there is a gym inhouse , but you can use the crunch gym next door ( same building ) that is much bigger and has everything . the entrance is not much to look at just an elevator to the sixth floor where reception is . but the bellman was friendly and the reception desk was efficient and very friendly . it does cost a lot to park here ( i think N night so don ' t bring a car ) . there is a small store next to reception , open N N . free wired and wireless internet in the room . only minor complaint is that the walls are somewhat thin so if the neighbor raises his voice i can hear it . also , i can hear water running next door . but all in all i would definitely stay here again . it ' s much more comfortable and better value than the big hotels nearby . 
my college best friend and i choose to visit chicago for a weekend and wanted to find a hotel with a good price and a decent location . the hilton chicago fit the bill and had a hilton double points offer , which was very appealing . it was also just a short cab ride from the train station . the check-in process took quite awhile as we had to wait in a rather long line . however , we were given a complimentary upgrade to one of their double-beded two bathroom rooms with a lakeview ( we had only booked a double-bedded room so i believe we got a bit of a deal ) . we were happy to have a lake view and it was immensely helpful to have two bathrooms ! however , there was only one hairdryer but we deduced that was so we don ' t blow a fuse , and we took turns . though it is not on the busy magnificant mile area ( it ' s a little farther south ) , it is still in a good location and a short walk to the field museum . the lobby and common areas are really impressive , with historic decor . 
i travel at least N times a yr for work and twice a year with family , so i put in a lot of time at hotels . my room was freezing cold and the thermometer in the room didn ' t make a difference . i was told by engineering that the hotel had turned on ac and it would take a couple of hours for the heat to come back on . i ended up taking a long hot shower and getting in bed and using the blow dryer to warm me up . they promised to send up hot tea , but after N minutes and no delivery i had to call to ask . about N minutes later a pot of tea showed up , but it was highly caffeinated breakfast tea at N N at night ! ! ! the same night , someone attempted to enter my room . luckily i had both locks on . i think it was housekeeping . i don ' t know how they couldn ' t hear the tv which was turned up loud so that i could hear it over the blowdryer ! ! ! the second day , i called guest services to tell them that my tv wasn ' t working . after hitting N and waiting about N rings , i hung up . i tried again and had the same experience . i thought , what if it was a medical emergency and no one answered ! ! ! ! the handle on my toilet had to be held in order for it to be flushed . it reminded me of my old house ! i called down for toothpaste N minutes ago . i ' m still waiting . given all of the choices in a downtown area like this and with the tough economy , there have to be other hotels that provide better service . 
the keys to my cadillac cts was given to someone off the street by the valet company . valet authority inc . which the hotel requires you to use . i am out of pocket for the insurance deductible and the rekeying of my home . this happened on my wedding night no less . they have been no help and evidently don ' t care to help resolve my remaining issues . the general manager called me once and left a message never bothering to return my calls and talk to me personally . 
my review of the hampton inn will be a little dated , but it definitely deserves high praise . my girlfried and i stayed here in august N for N nights . this was both our first time visiting chicago . we couldn ' t have been happier with our selection . we picked this place based on the reviews on tripadvisor . com . thanks to all for their honest reviews ! if you ' re looking for a place with a great location , this is it ! it was very easy to navigate throughout the city from this loaction . getting to the hotel from the airport was easy as well . one train stop will get you block or two away from the front door ! don ' t expect a grand entrance , because there is none . what you get in terms of value is the location , service , and room quality . we also enjoyed the continental breakfast every morning and the free wireless internet inside our room . if you don ' t have time to sit for breakfast , they offer free travel snack bags . chicago in the middle of summer was quite hot , but our air conditioner was excellent . the bed was amazingly comfortable . we were well rested day in and day out . as for location , you can ' t beat it . it is so close to public transportation and is walkable to many major tourists sites . it is also very close to many great restaurants and shopping . next time we go to chicago , we will be staying here ! great job majestic inn ! 
for a large chain hotel with a lot of conferences going on while we were there my sister and i felt the staff was extremely friendly and helpful . when i arrived at my room i requested an extra luggage stand , it arrived within minutes plus extra pillows . the door man was very helpful and explained the workings of the hotel . the outrageous charge for wifi is so over the top , it is free at small chain hotels ! it is free in the starbucks down in the lobby . the room was large , the beds very comfortable , the bath was well supplied , and the linens comfortable . the location is great , close to shopping and good restaurants . 
the hotel is getting a little dated . the stetson restaurants still has great steaks and impressive service . my husband was on business and i tagged along . he left for a business trip early in the morning with all bags so i could go home on the train without luggage . unfortunately he took all my clothes . he left early morning and i slept in and found out i only had a silk shell for clothing . called the hotel shop and they only carry t shirts so i called the front desk . vickie came to my rescue with an employee uniform so i could get to a store and purchase clothes . even though i usually don ' t stay here i will definetly be staying here every time i am in chicago . vickie thank you again . 
do not book this hotel using an online site like hotels . com ! ! we booked a king bed non smoking for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary . upon arriving a very rude front deck clerk informed us that they " crowne plaza metro " did not have to honor our king bed booking because it was made with an online service and instead we were going to get a double room . if we didnt take it we would lose all the money . final in the room we find two small beds . im a big guy . so , to make a long story short . i spent my anniversary sleeping alone . my wife woke the next day with a rash from the detergent they use . ( we hope thats what it was ) so thank you crowne plaza metro for an anniversary that nether my wife or i will ever forget ! 
i travel often for business and stay at N-N star hotels as well as the usual marriott courtyard or hilton hotels . this hotel was great . i reserved the king executive which had windows facing michigan avenue as well as on the adjacent wall . we could not believe how quiet the room was-- no noise from michigan avenue or other guests , etc . amazingly and wonderfully quiet hotel room . the room was well appointed , huge , and immaculate . ( any hotel that puts stark white comforters on the beds has confidence in its cleanliness and i always take that as a good sign . ) the big surprise at this hotel was the dining . i almost never dine at the restaurants in a hotel at which i am staying . ( usually too many great other options in a city ) we had a case of the munchies upon checking in so we ordered appetizers via room service . service was quick , sharp , and the food was very good . the next day , we had lunch at the Nth floor rooftop garden restaurant ( outdoors ) which has a fabulous view and again , was amazingly quiet given the location of this hotel . the food was fantastic . we only ordered maine lobster roll sandwiches so we were ' t expecting an amazing culinary experience . . . . surprise ! the presentation was lovely and the lobster roll came on a platter with several " samplers " --- soup , cabbage slaw , homemade chips , and a sinful chocolate mouse cake . i ' ve had lobster rolls in dozens of places up and down the eastern seaboard and i ' ll tell you that this was the best , most flavorful , and freshest i ' ve had . the whole dining experience greatly exceeded my expectations . i would say that this hotel is a gem in the city and recommend it without reservation of any kind . enjoy ! 
N adults and N elementary-aged kids stayed for a N day , N night spring break . we loved the fact that our two rooms faced each other across a private alcove off the main hall . the rooms were very clean , beds comfortable and pillows large and fluffy . the tv was a new flat screen and there was an in-room safe . would have been nice to have a small fridge but we did okay without . the front desk staff was exceptionally friendly each day especially wallace , the concierge . the pool is rather hard to get too from the east end of the hotel and was chilly . no hottub . all in all , i would give this hotel N stars out of N . 
my husband and i just returned from the omni . we were there for just a N night stay . . . december N-N . since it was a holiday weekend , the hotel , and the rest of the city was jammed . our experience there was wonderful . we had a prompt and friendly check in . our room was very comfortable and clean . beautiful granite counters in the bathroom , pillow-top beds , and the living area were especially nice to relax in . i would encourage anyone who is considering a stay at the omni to join the select guest program they offer . it ' s free , and little amenities like juice and coffee delivered to your room free in the morning are really nice . we called on the concierge , both amiri and kevin , several times and each time they were able to help us and direct us to great restuarants , activities , etc . both were very helpful and amiri was kind enough to see that we got a wonderful bottle of wine or champagne on our anniversary . if when we return to chicago , i would most likely stay at the omni again , especially if we could get the same great rate . 
i went to chicago for a wedding and the wedding guests stayed at elysian . seriously this is the most amazing , outstanding hotel . my room was so luxurious i actually wished i had more time to spend in it ! i had a great living room area . the bathroom was gorgeous too with a great tub shower the tv in the mirror . 
my husband and i had stayed at the swissotel several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed our visit . we flew into chicago and rented a car to tour wisconsin before attending a board meeting there . we decided to spend the last night of our trip , on our return to chicago , at the swissotel for memories sake . we were able to get an outstanding lake view room for sunday night . though the hotel was completely booked , due to two conventions on friday and saturday nights , when we decided to stay an extra night on saturday , we were wait listed for that night . even though there was a mix-up with our original sunday night booking and it and our wait-list had been lost , upon calling back , the person i spoke with was able to confirm a wonderful lake view room on the Nst floor for both nights . once again we had a most delightful stay and thoroughly enjoyed the terrific view of lake michigan . our room was beautiful , extremely comfortable , and incredibly clean . perhaps my only complaint is the N per day parking fee , but that seems to be the norm for large cities . our two meals in their palm restaurant was another story . see separate review . 
went for a long weekend , a " last hurrah " trip before son N leaves for college . we are getting very spoiled and are leaning towards four seasons whenever it is a choice ( and when we can get a deal that is only outrageous , not astronomical ! ) although the hotel seemed almost N N empty . . . there were really no deals to be had other than the buy two nights , one night free . this would have been too expensive for us with two rooms , ( which is what we really wanted ) so we crammed into a deluxe executive suite , approx N night with taxes . . . ( and don ' t forget the N plus per night parking ! ) whew ! lucky that third night was " free " . but we knew all this going in so it is not a strike against the hotel . but what is does is set expectations extremely high . . . the lobby is beautiful , large , sunny , nice fountain in the middle . our room , on the Nth floor . . . . eh . . . . it had a main sitting room with a pull out couch , then the master bedroom separated by frosted french doors . it did have two bathrooms , but they were small and not " luxurious " at all , with combined bath shower . also , we joked about the " ergodynamic " toilets . . . they are kind of low , and rather tilt you backwards . there was enough room for the four of us , but tight when the rollaway was out . the main king size bed was extremely comfortable , nice fluffy bath towels and i love those four seasons robes . it was clean . oddly there was no tv channel information , that would have been appreciated . of course teen sons quickly figured out the remote to get channel listings , but my old eyes couldn ' t see it very well on the t . v . when laying on the bed . you can request newspapers to be delivered to your door every morning , which we did . we went down to look at the spa pool area first thing . it was unimpressive , to say the least . the pool is a small , very small lap pool . the whirlpool was small and didn ' t look very appealing at all , like not so clean , and not filled all the way ? as far as i could tell , it was not being cleaned at the time as there was no sign and a family was in it ! i did work out in their gym , and the equipment , for a hotel gym , was very good . nice touch to have cooled towels available and someone going around bringing everyone water . we did not eat at the hotel , nor did very many others by the look of the lobby restaurant every time we passed by . we did have coffee and drinks at the lobby bar , that was nice ( and , yes , expensive ! ) so yes , i liked this hotel , didn ' t love it , probably will try somewhere else in the future as for me , it did not justify the cost and have that " four seasons " feeling . it ' s not fair to compare a city four seasons to a resort four seasons ( like nevis , one of the most magical stays in the world ) but i have stayed at the st . louis four seasons , which was , to me , way more impressive than this one , and will be staying at the four seasons philadelphia in a few weeks , which my husband has already stayed in , and loves . i will then have a direct , big city four seasons comparison . 
got an excellent deal on hotels . com a few months back . rooms were stately and huge ( living room area with chairs and couch and separate dining room table ) . kitchenette with amenities . big bedroom with full bath and a half-bath between living room and bedroom . complimentary breakfast was tasty and filling . only N per night for a roll-away . elevators are quite slow , the only drawback . located near the lake and close to the magnificent mile . 
although i have lived in chicago for years and occasionally spend a weekend downtown , i was unaware of this little gem . the hotel is well-located to attractions , shopping , and restaurants . the decor is elegant and modern . the lounge area with the compimentary wine hour in the evenings and the coffe tea service in the mornings is a nice touch . we had booked a one-bedroom luxury suite and a double queen room for six women celebration a special birthday . one woman in our group is a frequent guest at this hotel so she was able to procure a very good rate . she also asked that special note be made of the birthday celebration and asked for wine and a small cake to be delivered to the room - not necessarily complimentary but to have these items available . by the day of check-in she had not heard back from the concierge and expressed her disappointment at the front desk . they quickly made amends by first , delivering wine , nuts , fruit , and chocolate-covered espresso beans . then at N , two excellent cheese plates were delivered . when we returned to the room after dinner , a small strawberry shortcake cake was waiting for us . we we also given an extra cot at no extra charge for the suite . the service , decor , and charm of this hotel will have me back for a repeat visit . 
i had my doubts about this hotel when i first blind booked through a third party site . the price was just a little too good and the location too perfect for it to be real . we breathed a sigh of relief when we walked into our room . upon arrival they " upgraded " us to a top floor , corner room and what an awesome room it was . we were staring right at the hancock building and lake michigan . for those of you planning a visit to the american girl store , you will be happy to know , it is half a block away and within view of the hotel . the beds were comfortable and not too small . the bathroom was very nice , updated and clean . the shower was a bit finicky but that is to be expected in an older building . and the room did have a slight musty odor upon arrival but that went away after a few hours - again , older building . the hotel staff was courteous and attentive . they were more than happy to point us in the direction of cheaper parking rather than pay for valet - they do not have a parking lot on site . there are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area as it is just off of michigan avenue . i would definitely stay there again . 
overall this hotel is nice . i agree with the previous reviewer who said the rooms are too dark to work . the rooms have no overhead lighting outside the bathroom and have just one lamp that is supposed to light the whole room , but does a poor job . there are three other lamps- one on the desk and two by the bed , but they are primarily made for reading , not illuminating the room . the exercise room was good , the staff was friendly . overall it was a fine hotel . my one gripe is with the room i was first given . it was room N . i ' m giving this just to warn others in case you get this room . there are very few rooms on the Nth floor , so i ' m betting the problem is with all of them . initially , i noticed that the room had two big spotlights outside the window that are used to illuminate the top of the building . i ' m sure it looks cool from outside , but it will force you to close those blinds ( therefore robbing you of your view ) because they are quite bright . not a huge deal- i just closed the blinds . the second problem i noticed was a banging noise that happened every minute or so . i ' m a sound sleeper , so didn ' t think it would bother me . but every N minutes or so there was a much louder bang rattling noise . it was loud enough to make me jump each time it happened . the first time i thought someone was breaking down the door to my room . i think it must have been noise from the mechanical room , which i noticed was also on the Nth floor . not being one to cause a fuss , i decided to try and deal with it . well , by Nam i was wide awake in my bed awaiting the next jarring bang ! i finally gave up and called the front desk around Nam and they were nice enough to give me another room . not sure what i would have done had the hotel been sold out because i could not have gotten a good night sleep with that noise . i can ' t imagine i ' m the only person who has had this experience with this room unless this was a temporary problem within their hotel . so my gripe here is that they put anyone in that room at all considering N of the population would have a very difficult time sleeping through the noise . so overall i ' d say it ' s a fine hotel as long as you don ' t stay on the Nth floor . or if you happen to notice a loud noise in your room , change rooms immediately . don ' t wait around hoping the noise will stop like i did . 
we stayed at the knickerbocker hotel from jun N-july N N . my first mistake was purchasing this hotel stay through hotwire , which i will never use their service again . don ' t get stuck at a place you can ' t get your money back . my second mistake was actually staying there . i can ' t believe they consider this hotel a N star hotel . whoever rated this hotel as such must have been drinking and smoking something . this is a solid N-star hotel . the rooms are extremely small and not well maintained . it ' s an old hotel so there is layer upon layer of paint on the walls and molding . at first we had a room with a queen bed , which gave us about N feet on each side . the bathroom door could touch the bed . only one person can fit in the bathroom . there is no place to put your toiletries because it ' s a single sink . the wallpaper was peeling in various places . then we moved to a room with a king bed . that was a little better a little more room . the decor was horrible . it looked as if they picked up the items from a flea market . now , the location is great . it ' s a N N block from michigan ave . , which was a plus . but , i do not recommend this hotel or hotwire . 
location was great for me , as my son lives around the corner ! nice little neighborhood area , lots of pubs , restaurants , theatre district nearby . i was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews , and our initial reception wasn ' t very friendly , as we waited for over N minutes for valet parking . couldn ' t seem to get anyone ' s attention to leave the car . but adter that , it was a very nice experience and i will stay there again . concierges were super , room was lovely and well-appointed . only complaint about room was the feather pillows- i don ' t like them , asked for firmer pillow , but the maid brought more puffly pillows . bring your own if you like a firmer one ! but the bed was very firm , super comfortable . cool-lloking lobby , friendly staff , good value for the price . i ' ll stay again for sure . 
september N , N this was the first time i was in chicago . this was a very good experience . we got there before check in and they let us get into the room early . if we weren ' t able to they would allow you to store your luggage in a locked room before and after check out . the room was clean . the beds were comfortable . it has a large screen tv with hbo . the bathroom had a coffee pot , coffee , cream , sugar and cups . the ice machine was close by with reasonable priced pop . the closet had a iron and ironing board . it also stated that if you didn ' t remember to bring you razor , toothbrush , toothpaste etc . . they could provide it for you . the pool and whirlpool was inside and clean and with towels . the free breakfast was outstanding . it had homemade waffles , scrambled eggs , bacon , sausage , muffins , bagels , yogurt , fruit , coffee , cereal , tea and juices . the shower head had many settings and they provided shampoo and soap . it had a desk and chair in the room with free internet hookup . i was also very impressed on how nice the workers treated you . i felt it was necessary to let someone know . pros swimming pool , whirl pool , free awesome breakfast cons couldn ' t stay longer ! 
first , we chose the doubletree for and extended chicago weekend because we wanted to be close to public transportation , and to the downtown area . in addition we were confident that the doubletree brand would not have any unwanted surprises . we were not surprised ! the hotel is located a few blocks from the chicago river and the boat rides and a few blocks from navy pier . the concierge was extremely helpful when we needed information on using public transport to oak park ( home of the flwright museum ) and the university of chicago ( home of the robie house ) . he pointed us to the grocery store two blocks away where we bought all day subway bus passes which proved invaluable . the room itself was comfortable and fairly spacious . no complaints here . the only downside , as is often the case with higher-priced hotels , is that in-room wifi is N a day although its free in the hotel lobby . on the first day , the service kept cutting out , and , on check out , i mentioned this to the front desk and was immediately credited ! the view from our room was great and the lake is visible from most floors . there is an einstein bagel store in the lobby which proved immensely popular in the morning . be prepared for a bit of wait . one morning we ventured in the hotel restaurant for a typical , over-priced , breakfast . while seated , we could not help but notice the frequent arrival of natives chicagoans , across the street in a place called the west egg cafe . the line soon went out the door . we tried it the next day , and are delighted to report it was twice as good and half as expensive as the hotel ! don ' t miss this place for breakfast . all in all , a good choice . 
i stayed here for a conference in late april N . i liked the view from the hotel ( river view from the room , but a fabulous lake view from the elevator area ) . the hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky , and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy . one of my colleagues had to ask to get his room moved at N am due to the noise of moving elevators . the beds were comfortable , and i liked having ihome to plug my ipod . while the lcd tv was nice , free channels did not contain any hd broadcast , and we all know how painful it is to watch sd broadcaston a hdtv . they also charge to use the fitness center , which seems quite outrageous . i also paid for the wifi access . 
i have previously stayed at this hotel and enjoyed it . i stayed about four or five years ago for my birthday and was really impressed . i felt then that it was well managed and well maintained , which is difficult for a hotel of this size and capacity . this time around , i was also impressed overall ( although not very impressed by the rooms , somewhat dated , although nothing major , and they are fine given that you dont spend the bulk of your time in chicago in the room ) . the hotel itself seems very well maintained and has a lot of amenities ( business center , a few restaurants , bars , great location on the river , pool , parking ( although a rip off at N when you can go next door , literally , for N ) and nice views . overall , for the price in chicago i would rate this hotel pretty well , and it should be noted that i am pretty picky when it comes to hotels ! this hotel has a great fitness center overlooking the river ! the pool is okay , i never understand why hotels have pools and not hot tubs . . . this hotel does not have a hot tub , that would be a nice addition if they did . overall the hotel is nice , well kept and staff seemed friendly . the one complaint i have is that on a sunday morning starting pretty early around N or N am , the cleaning staff were being particularly loud in our hallway . i thought it was a group of hotel guests and was getting seriously annoyed , but was extremely surprised to find out that it was the cleaning crew that worked for the hotel . that was pretty irritating . the cleaning staff we did encounter were really nice , but might want to be a little more cognizant of the fact that guests want to relax and sleep in on vacation sometimes ! also , the tub in our bathroom did not work , it was stuck on the shower setting , and when i tried to run a bath , the tub spout almost came out of the wall ( i meant to tell front desk but did not get a chance ) might be time for an upgrade to the rooms sheraton , otherwise , well done hotel , especially such a large property ! lastly , i must mention , we ate sunday brunch in the hotel and it was seriously awesome , the chefs who made our omelets and crepes at the create your own bars were so enthusiastic and fun , and the food was great , a ton to offer . almost as good as the breakfast buffets on our honeymoon in bora bora , which is a major accolade for those of you who have never been to bora bora . nice work on the buffet . again have to say the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful here ! 
we held our annual user conference at the allerton hotel . the staff is attentive and the hotel seems to have low turnover as we see the same faces year-to-year . the food is excellent and the rooms are small but well appointed . 
the people were very friendly , rooms were comfortable , clean and of modern european style . the location is very good . i would have given it a N rating but for the following N . close to a busy hospital ( ambulance sirens at odd hours of the night ) . N . one of the elevators was not working when i checked in on a sat until i left on a tues . had to use the freight elevator both times . N . had a smoke alarm battery beep at N a . m . ( just as i was falling back to sleep after an ambulance siren woke me up ) . the front desk did not have replacement batteries but she did come up to remove the unit so i could get some sleep . i would recommend this place if you are not a light sleeper . 
this is our second stay at this hotel . the location is perfect for anything you want to do in downtown chicago . the staff are all very friendly , the rooms clean and very secure . the complimentary breakfast is far more than just a danish and coffee . . . there was a nice selection of fresh fruit , yogurt , cereal , fresh waffles and beverages . the dining area was very clean . the complimentary high-speed wireless internet was a nice bonus . we will certainly be back ! 
we stayed at the hyatt for six days . their service was efficient and courteous . the room was new and clean . it was spacious and had two double beds . the room looked just like the picture of a double bed room on the hotel ' s website . we enjoyed a comfortable stay . no complaints ! the fan in the bathroom was running all night long and was noisy . i did not bring the problem to the attention of the hotel . the following nights , i simply closed the bathroom door so i won ' t hear the on going noise from the bathroom fan . the fan kept the bathroom dry . no moisture or fogged up mirror . the sleep quality rating i gave had to do with the fan noise . 
have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted . great bar ( draught stella and guinness ) which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there , good food , lovely staff , large clean rooms , comfortable beds , spot on location for the golden mile , joey ' s pizzas next door are fantastic . ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please . highly recommended
i was a little hesitant to book a room here after reading the reviews , but decided that the location would make up for any problems . a year ago i stayed downtown and was very unimpressed with one of the five stars . the reception i received was very nice . the staff at the desk were very helpful and answered all of my many questions pleasantly . they even did some investigation for me when i asked about a specific church ( where my parents were married N years ago ) . my blind father and i were given a rather nice room , and the bathroom was huge ! we had a small coffee maker and a refrigerator . the room was clean . the decor is definitely old , but charming . the beds were comfortable and clean . i was very pleased not to have feathers in the room ( allergy which i made note of on my reservation ) . we had many channels on the tv to choose from . we did not need to use the window air conditioner . breakfast was free . . . and , considering , not bad . it is a self-serve style buffet . if you want eggs , bacon , waffles , etc . , they were available , but you had to microwave them yourself . bagels , muffins , donuts , cereal , coffee , tea , juices , etc . were all there for you . the breakfast room was very pleasant and clean . the attending staff were pleasant . i accidentally dropped a whole cup of juice . . . they rushed over to clean up my spill and just would not hear of it when i tried to clean it up myself . fresh fruit was available in the lobby N hours day , along with coffee and tea . cookies were available in the afternoon . internet access was available . . . free connection in the lobby , a free computer also available . i don ' t understand why internet access in the rooms incurred a charge . all staff were aware that my dad was blind , and they were very kind and helpful when he was navigating the hotel alone . parking was right outside the lobby door , and a back-up garage was available if the parking lot was full . i did not need to use the garage . sadly , this hotel is scheduled for demolition in three or four years and will probably be replaced with something outrageously expensive . overall , this hotel was just what we needed . not fancy , but nice people , clean surroundings , safe , and in an excellent location . 
we come to chicago once a year for a romantic get away . the talbott is our favorite hotel so far . you get the same amenities as " bigger names " , but with a price that is very reasonable and a cozier atmosphere . location is great , staff helpful and friendly . i personally love a smaller hotel that is quaint and high quality . highly recommend for those looking for the same . 
room very comfortable ( esp . after long flight ) . reception staff most helpful to N strangers to chicago , and breakfast bar excellent . easy walking distance or public transport to everywhere we wanted to go . 
stayed here on a travelzoo deal and during the taste of chicago . we came from mi city on the south shore train as to save on parking fees , which the station is about N blocks away . the el train system is also very close N-N blocks to several stations . very good location for our use . N block from the river , our room had river views out N sets of windows . also a good view of the new trump tower and the intesection of michigan ave and wacker . the room was about as big as you get in chicago , with new stuff in all the right places , N tvs and a washer and dryer . . no frills but very nice and not up tight . only complants was the tv in the bedroom only got N channels , but whos watching tv in the bedroom in downtown chicago anyways , and also N of the N elevators didnt work for the first N hrs we were there , causing a wait sometimes . would stay and recommend for the average person not looking for N star service but wanting a N star room . 
great location , very clean , and helpful staff . what more can i say ? 
stayed there for a tradeshow . hotel lobby looks more like an airport or factory . i don ' t know if all the rooms were as terrible as in the east tower , but i asked N times for another room and N times i got the same poor quality the rooms are very old ( old carpet , yellow curtains , dirty windows ) and the bathroom hasn ' t been upgraded since a long time . although the view ( on the lake ) was great , the rest was just horrible the doors have an opening of around N cm ' s between door and carpet ( no need to say you have the impression to sleep in the corridor ) and the old airco systems had to be turned down because of the noice . the breakfast room ( hall ) is not cozy , the bar is nice but expensive . i ' ll never go back ! ! ! ! ! 
others have made most of the points , so i won ' t belabor it . . . but when i walked in ( wearing dress shirt , sweater , and khakis ) at Npm on a weeknight there was some sniffing that i wasn ' t dressed properly . nothing wrong with this hotel , but nothing to blow me away . and the snobbishness is unnecessary . my room had a lovely view of another indistinguished building N feet away , which isn ' t the worst i ' ve had , but was hoping for a better view given the building height . 
great hotel in heart of chicago for business or pleasure . rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large . flat screen tvs , marble baths , all rooms are suites , great desk , kitchenette , comfortable bed , free wireless internet . . . everything you could ask for . location is easy walk to magnificient mile and lots of great restaurants . staff is friendly and helpful . short cab ride to loop . 
arrived at the westin and was treated to a beautiful room with a view of michigan avenue . service was great and the location could not have been better - it is steps away from world class shopping , dining and many architectural gems . while all staff members were gracious and helpful , ashley stood out . she was so focused on helping making the most of my visit she referred my companions and me to a an absolutely wonderful restaurant . she also arranged for a slightly later check out which really helped me out and saved me time . the room and bed were very comfortable . thanks to everyone at the westin for making this trip so delightful . 
i can ' t say enough good things about this hotel ! we were lost in the parking lot and a very kind man pointed us the way out . he was the manager off duty ! a very sweet maid greeted us on the way to our room . the room was very nicely decorated and very quiet . at breakfast the next morning the room was packed but the staff was so quick and friendly the tables were ready right away . i would stay here again ! 
the hotel staff at front desk was super , the only reason why i did not lower the score more . xavier , was pleasant cordial both days . the lobby with the big pumpkins . . . lovely . they offer free breakfast , but i didn ' t try it . it is a close enough walk to magnificent mile , close enough walk to the gold coast , and wacker drive . down side , the little guy with the glasses the worked in the bar , i observed him being rude snotty to everyone . poor customer relations . my room , it was big , roomy , the living room area was nice , however the bathroom . . . uuhh the tub needed to be recoated , the toilet paper holder was stuck in a hole in a wall , with a piece of soap wrapper to keep it place , the view . . . a parking garage and i guess dumpsters . oh and if you need to go to the airport in the morning . . . . contact a sedan car service ! ! ! ! the under N miles to chicago o ' hare took N hour N minutes . . . and that is after the actual N minutes it took to get a cab to agree to take us , they would stop and ask , " airport ? " we say yes and they just drive off , really ? i was afraid i was going to miss my flight . we had to hide our luggage behind the planters for the cabs to even pull over . the nice door guy tried so hard too ! so what happened ? i arrived at the airport ( i was checked in online ) slightly under the N minutes to drop off my one checked bag , so i had to reschedule my flight to N Npm or beg to see if my bag would make it then hustle to my gate . i have been to chi N times . it is a lot of work and nothing to do but eat , shop , and go to museums . just be prepared . . . it is not as simple as nyc or la . imo
i arrived by taxi from the airport very late at night . the reservation was ok , check in without problems . the suite was perfect place to stay and work , good light , very comfortable bed and enough space for me . the small kitchenette worked well , restaurant offerred all i needed and the location is great for all downtown access . highly recommend to use this hotel . 
this was the Nnd best hotel i ' ve stayed in in chicago ( only Nnd to the hilton towers south michigan ave ) . prior to arrival i emailed the room coordinator and requested a two bed two bath non somking room and was granted my request within an hour ! no problems even thought we got the room for only N through priceline . this is a huge bargain rooms usually begin at just under N and can go up to N . all of the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and helpful . they never passed us by without saying hello . the lobby is magnificent and the hotel is located in an ideal location in the loop . just a N . N cab ride from union station . the room was exceptionally clean . the hilton beds are extremely comfortable . the wall paper in the bathroom was quite outdated but goes with the theme of the older hotel . the only other draw back was the bathroom mirror is small but we had two bathrooms so we had no problem getting ready in the morning , we were sad to have to leave the palmer and can ' t wait to go back . 
let me say up front that the swanky , loud , disco lobby was way not for us . much to much going on there , lobby restaurant was average at the very best . but , but . we got a great rate and our , room , bed and bathroom were among the very finest that we have ever stayed in . the bed was supercomfortable , the bathroom was spa like . in general the room had a feeling of relaxed elegance . we would stay here again despite the disco lobby . housekeeping satff was awesome . 
there was a group of N that travelled to chicago recently and spent N nights at the allegro . we all loved it from the friendly service when we checked in to the very helpful concierge . the rooms were small but fine . the location was perfect . we walked to the magnificent mile . . . to the sears tower and took a boat tour on the chicago river . i would definitely go back to the allegro . . . they also had a wine hour every night . very enjoyable trip . 
if you take a trip to chicago , definitely consider staying here . i have stayed in various hotels throughout chicago over N years and this was my favorite hotel because of the staff , location , and overall value . below are the highlights staff -- extremely helpful and knowledgeable . it ' s been a year since i regularly stayed in this hotel and the doorman remembered who i was . the front desk staff was efficient and courteous . we were flying in to meet family and friends so i just found danita ' s email and asked for her help . she was amazing and professional throughout the entire process . in a hotel with a thousand rooms she provided bed and breakfast quality attention . location -- perfect location to easily get around chicago . walking distance to some of our favorite restaurants ( volare , quartino , west egg cafe , yolk ) , navy pier , michigan avenue , and even a free shuttle bus to a casino ! rooms facility -- the beds were very comfortable and even better than i remember . they had just replaced them when i was leaving . the bars and restaurants in the hotel are convenient . 
we booked the american girl package . our cost for N nights for N double beds was over N dollars . our room was supposed to be upgraded , but did not seem that terrific to me . the beds were comfortable , the room was small and outdated . the bathroom was in need of a remodel . the room was a really standard room . there is an expensive mini bar , took some things out , to put some of my things in , ( then put their things back before we left . --nothing perishable ) we did get valet parking included , and a fold out bed for the doll , which my daughter liked . she also got some cupcakes and milk . this hotel is in a great location , you can easily walk to michigan ave and the all important american girl store . there is a mcdonalds in easy walking distance if you have kids . if i was able to get this hotel for N dollars a night , i would take it . but not for what we paid . just too expensive for what you get . there are other hotels in the same area , would check them out first . my daughter did use the pool , the pool was nice , but the air temperature in the pool area was stifling hot , no air circulation , so unless you were in the pool it was uncomfortable . i am glad we got an opportunity to stay in this hotel . it was fun to stay in the city . 
we stayed at the crown plaza for two days . the location was great , right off of michigan street , close to everything . the room was great , the service was great . the only advice i can give is to make sure you read the note on the refrigerator , if you store your own food in it you will be charged a N . N fee . . 
this hotel is absolutely brilliant . only stayed here one night , but everything was spot on . they had a courtyard outside of the hotel so you could relax in the cool september air and soak in the " hustle and bustle " of chicago . it was great ! ! ! i would recommend this hotel to anyone needing a nice and upscale place to stay . it ' s worth it . 
lovely remodeled rooms with two comfy lounge chairs . no flat-screen , but i ' m sure that will come . very friendly and helpful staff . trendy , good restaurant . reasonable prices and walk to buddy guy ' s and jazz club . a little far from the north circle action , but on a quiet street and easy access to the el or busses . large room . twin sinks are nice . 
i have stayed here N nights . if you look for an inexpensive place at a central location , then this is the place for you . the room is your standard motel room ( i booked on their website paid only N night ) , if a bit outdated . parking is free , and while i was there ( thursday friday nights ) finding a free spot was never a problem . also , i didn ' t worry about safety , as the staff are watching closely who is entering the premises . . 
the palmer house is located in the city of chicago , il . the rooms here are all first rate-although prices are high there are times when you can get great deals-during holiday seasons , and other promotional deals . the lobby of this hotel is unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! just sitting at the bar having a drink is an incredible experience . at christmas and before , the famous christmas tree is put up-really puts you in the spirit . 
stayed here over labor day N . had free hotel points to use . great location right off magnificent mile . walking distance to navy pier as well ( half mile or so ) . there are better hotel options but it served its purpose . small rooms , and hotel has some age . small hotel bar in lobby and coffee shop connected . very small elevators so beware . nice balcony on upper floor with great views . have to walk a little ways for dinning options , none onsite . 
this hotel is by far one of our favorites in chicago . then again how couldn ' t it be . . . every time you walk in the door they offer you hot cookies ! it is fun , hip and luxurious without any pretense . the view from the rooftop bar is wonderful ! plus it ' s location right on state street is amazing ! don ' t think twice . . . stay there ! 
this is a great hotel with some amazing views of the lake and the river . of course , with the building boom in chicago , you also get a view into several construction sites , quite fascinating . the room has all you would expect from a business hotel and the bed is to die for ! ! ! but i don ' t believe it ' s worth the regularly advertized price . . . so be sure to hold out for discount rates . while we were there the elevators kept malfunctioning , often leaving people stranded on their floor during the moring check-out rush . i was also disappointed that their shower product bottles were not recyclable , indicating a serious lack of basic corporate environmental responsibility . 
we booked a room on the N ' th of may for one night at the avenue crowne plaza in downtown chicago . the reason we chose this hotel was that it was a special occasion for us and we wanted to stay in an excellent hotel and the reviews for your hotel were good . but once we checked in , we were very disappointed with the level of service provided to us . the receptionist who checked us in , a woman named arta , was very impolite and did not even have the courtesy to give us a smile . we had booked the room using a friend and family quote and she made us feel as if we had done something wrong by using a coupon provided by your hotel itself . after booking the rooms on the internet we had placed a request the the rooms be close to each other and preferable on a higher floor as it was our first time in chicago and we would have liked a nice view . when we checked in , arta said she did not receive any request and gave us what was available . when we went to see the rooms , we were very disappointed . one of the rooms ( N ) were still ok , but the other one ( N ) was much smaller , dirtier and had a broken fridge . we went down to the receptionist and when we told her we did not like the room , she gave us attitude and said " whats wrong with the room ? its a nice room . " she offered us another room but it turned out that it was a similar room on a floor that was much lower than our friends ' rooms . so we decided to stay in the original room , even though we were not comfortable there . we were highly disappointed with the overall experience , from check in to check out . we spent extra money because we wanted to stay in the crowne plaza and experience a different level of comfort but after this experience , i feel we would be better off staying in a days inn or a motel N that would have the same level of service but at least a lower price . 
as others have mentioned , the location can ' t be beat . we stayed three nights , june N-N . hotel has gone down a bit since i stayed last year ( june N ) . i am a priority club member but didn ' t really get anything from the intercontinental to show for it , not even a newspaper outside the door . had requested a room with a view and thought it would be fairly easy since it was the weekend . the room faced a construction site so most of our view was of the cranes outside . don ' t know why they couldn ' t have done better since hotel was not that crowded . they did put us in a king-size , as requested , but the very small room made it seem quite cramped . other minor annoyances included a bathroom exhaust fan that didn ' t work ( steam took forever to dissipate making shaving etc . next to impossible ) and toilet that wouldn ' t flush unless you held down handle for whole cycle . another minor peeve was the very strict instructions from the pool gym attendant to shower before using the pool . i have no problem with this , but the pool was filled with kids and during the times i was there i didn ' t see one of them ever leave to go use the bathroom , so you can only imagine ! hotel staff were polite but not particularly accommodating . at checkout , they noted it but weren ' t too concerned when i told them bathroom needed some maintenance . i will definitely look elsewhere next time i ' m in chicago . 
chicago is gorgeous and there are numerous great hotels . the best is the peninsula . the location is perfect , right off michigan and in the midst of everything . the entrance does not completely portray the beauty of the hotel , as you leave your luggage , and take the elevator to the lobby level . then , it begins--a beautiful arcade hallway , leading to the concierge and reception , with a continental restaurant serving three meals and afternoon tea and the best sunday brunch . they also had a talented three piece jazz band on saturday night . down a flight is a top chinese restaurant , and in the building is a french brasserie . the decorating is absolutely first rate , and then there are the rooms . we were fortunate to get their N for N deal , and also an upgrade to a suite , which included a complimentary mini cooper with driver . the bathrooms are large and perfect , there is a dressing room and closets and drawers , and the beds and furnishings are comfortable and lovely . my granddaughter began saic , which is the art school attached to the beautiful art museum down the street , and i also met with specialist doctors at northwestern medical down the street . simply , a great weekend at a truly great hotel . 
the hotel is really well located for exploring chicago being less than half a mile from the magnificent mile and millenium park . we stayed in a king spa room on the Nth floor which overlooked the river and didn ' t suffer from the noise issues other people have mentioned . the room was a good size with a huge bath tub and separate shower . the staff were really friendly and helpful . there are some negatives though . housekeeping was a bit hit and miss with basic things like toilet rolls not replaced and one day the room didn ' t get cleaned at all . you shouldnt have to phone up and remind them to do these things when you ' re paying over N a night . the room is pretty pricey so you would expect it to have everything you need . however , toiletries in the bathroom weren ' t enough for N people and there was no bath gel provided which , given the bath is the main reason why you ' d book the spa room , this seemed a bit tight . the hotel seemed to charge a lot for things other comparable hotels would provide for free such as web access and bottles of water . also , there ' s a N restocking charge for the mini bar even if you just take one item out of it . we ate in the hotel restaurant and the first time our waiter was brilliant , very accommodating and helpful . the second time however the service was poor with the waitress bringing out our main courses N mins after bringing out our starters and trying to cram them on the table , and forgot to pick up our drinks order from the bar so we had to fetch them ourselves . didnt eat there again after that . it ' s a great hotel but for the price there probably are better places to stay . 
i stayed here when i attended a conference in chicago . the location is hard to beat , and that ' s about all i can say about this hotel . amenities and service were almost non-existent . no breakfast ( no restaurant , even ) , no free in-room internet , no fitness facility ( for that you need to pay N day and walk three blocks to the doubletree ) . i couldn ' t even find an ice machine ! i had to go to the hotel bar for ice . the bartender begrudgingly fulfilled my request for a wineglass ( " once i give these out , they never come back . " ) there was supposedly a part-time concierge , but one never seemed to be at the desk . my bed was comfortable , and the room clean and basic . no complaints there . the air-conditioner , however , was horribly loud and cycled on and off every N minutes . i could not run it at night and sleep . the bathroom was ridiculously small , and the sink placed so that it partially blocked the doorway . there was also mold on the wall and ceiling . i didn ' t have any problems with the check-in staff , and i found the bellhops to be very helpful . all in all , i wouldn ' t stay here again . 
personal trainer sam great people skills and training skills concierge dianne and lisa very helpful , housekeeping lady very nice - complemented us on our room
i would definitely recommend hotelN . it was clean , rooms were spacious nice . staff was friendly , our room was cleaned daily no matter what time we left . didn ' t have to wait terribly long for elevators because there are N for bottom floors N for upper floors . the hotel is very centrally located . only thing i would have liked is to have a fridge and personal safe in room . also very happy with purchasing in advance through skoosh , got the room we were promised at a good price ! 
i am a gold member to several different hotels including hilton , marriot so to say the least i spend a lot of times in hotels . i would rank this much higher than the top N in chicago . if you are lucky enough to get a river view you will be treated to a great room with a view , i am sure the other sides are good . the service is fantastic ! from the front desk to the concierge each of the staff act as if they own the hotel and want you to enjoy your stay . i cannot wait to get back and spend another night . also be sure to look for deals as this hotel does offer some specials from time to time . but even at their regular rates the hotel is worth it . give it a try . 
we have stayed at this hotel a number of times and remain impressed with the staff and service . although the breakfast line can be long the wait isn ' t long , the manager ' s reception is fantastic after a long day of meetings , shopping or sightseeing ! the rooms are spacious and comfortable . i will return again and again ! 
we stayed at the inn of chicago on two different trips . we were happy with our experience both times . the location is perfect for shopping and going to tourist sites . it ' s a great place to crash when visiting a great city ! 
this hotel met every expectation . we are " country " coming to a big city but the employees made my wife and i feel at home . we were close to everything around downtown chicago . this is a great place to stay and as usual , embassy suites was a Nst class place to stay . thanks you employees we will be back ! 
i booked this hotel by accident thinking it was as different one ( long and not particularly interesting story ! ) , and ended up very pleased with it . it ' s excellent value for money . my room was very large , with a separate sitting area with comfortable chairs and coffee table , and the sleeping area itself was also large , with a work desk . the room came with free wired internet access ( cabling supplied ) which was very much appreciated . the bathroom was also good with a large , deep bath . everything was spotlessly clean . the room was warm and quiet . the staff i came into contact with ( todd on front desk and sandra ( i think ) at breakfast were friendly , welcoming and helpful , which does add so much to a hotel stay . the price tells you that this is not a luxury hotel , but i think that you get far more for your money here than the price suggests . there are obviously frills you don ' t get , but they are really not an issue . there is no coffee maker in the room ( although there are water cups ) , but there is a cafe on the ground floor . frankly i ' d rather have it that way and get the free in-room internet access than pay the extortionate daily internet rate that so many more expensive hotels charge . the hotel is not central and there ' s not too much around it ( although i understand it ' s handy for the conference centre and chinatown ) , but there is a bus ( no . N ) which leaves for downtown directly opposite the hotel and drops you back off right in front of the hotel . it leaves every N mins , costs N . N for a single ride and got me from the hotel to the art institute in around N mins . i found it super-handy and it made not being located in central downtown a complete non-issue . as well as the cafe there is a restaurant and bar . i only used the restaurant for breakfast - warning breakfast portions are large ! i ordered more items than i could eat , thinking they ' d be much smaller . all well cooked . breakfast is ordered a la carte , rather than buffet , and is reasonably priced . i wasn ' t in a hurry , which was fine , but if you are expecting a dash-in , dash-out buffet option , you should probably leave a bit more time than you would normally . sandra was an excellent hostess . so , overall it ' s not a luxury hotel , but it doesn ' t provide budget-level service or accommodation . the staff is friendlier and more helpful and the rooms bigger , cleaner and better equipped than i ' ve had in many far more expensive hotels . 
our four days in chicago were great and the hotel was fantastic . everyone was helpful and very kind . our room was clean and cozy . it was a tad small but we didn ' t mind because it made up for the lack of space in other ways . we just had a fantastic time in chicago and the helpful staff made it more enjoyable . would book with them in a heart beat again ! ! ! ! ! 
just spent two nights at the james . loved it ! let me just say that the staff are outstanding . . . and that is the entire staff . the location is perfect for anything that you want to do downtown . weather was so nice that we walked down to the theatre district . . . nice N minute walk . just steps from michigan ave . lots of restaurants close by . ate at the hotel restaurant . . . . david burke ' s primehouse for dinner and breakfast . both times it was great - again the staff at the restaurant were outstanding . when we arrived at the hotel ( early ) they had a room ready . it had two double beds , but i preferred a king . . . . no problem - they gave me an upgraded room at no cost . great boutique hotel . this is the first time i stayed at the james - it will not be my last . 
breakfast the breakfast buffet was amazing , self serve hot line ( eggs , bacon ) and made to order omelets . N-N different types of donuts pastries . fruit was typically bananas , oranges , and cantalope or watermelon . pancakes with syrup or blueberries also available . cereal , yogurt , and granola also available . very impressed with food quality and selection for a free included breakfast . room living area of suite very spacious . rooms have microwave and fridge . bed very comfortable , pillows were the only negative - but they were pretty standard for hotels these days - down pillows that are very soft squishy where your head sinks into the pillow . service guest check in great job , also provided a free surprise dessert treat in our room upon arrival for my husband ' s birthday . concierge - not available after Npm . - ( we did not get much help regarding touristy attraction info - which seems like an everyday concierge request . we actually stopped in another hotel and received the help we needed . overall - despite negative opportunities listed we would definitely stay here again . the rooms were quiet and clean , bed very comfortable , breakfast was excellent and this was about N blocks north of the canal and N blocks west of navy pier . great hotel convenient location . 
i stayed at this property for N nights . it was centrally located in downtown chicago . the staff was warm friendly . i had a long trip the front desk made sure my room was ready when i checked it . the price was very affordable for a business person . would definitely stay again . 
the hotel had a couple things going for it including location ( only a short walk away from millennium park and navy pier , not terribly far from michigan avenue shopping ) , a courteous and prompt valet staff , and it was relatively quiet . beyond that i don ' t think it was worth the price paid . upon check-in they didn ' t have the type of room that i had originally booked . i wasn ' t willing to shell out more cash for an upgrade so i was forced to settle for a room that didn ' t really suit me . the woman at the front desk didn ' t seem very sympathetic to this and was clearly irritated by my inquiries as to why my room wasn ' t available or if they could do anything for me . also , while it was to be expected , any extras were steep . valet , room service , minibar , pool fitness center , and so on . i ' ll admit that i ' m not used to staying at nicer hotels but some of the charges seemed over-the-top . i suppose i would have understood if the hotel wasn ' t so underwhelming as a whole -- the lobby , the rooms , etc . everything was so bland ( design-wise especially ) , i really was expecting more based on the prices . on the bright side , the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nice ( a variety of toiletries were offered and the fixtures seemed newer ) . so , after walking around the city and seeing all the places i could have booked , i was pretty bummed . i ' d research all your downtown hotel options if you have time because there ' s plenty better than this one . 
i had a wonderful stay here and was surprised to find this hotel to be very glam . the bed was beyond comfortable , room service very efficient , front desk staff friendly and a great value to boot . and it is walkable to everywhere in the city . 
i booked our N night stay at the allerton through their website and got a king bed room for N night . i would suggest flying there if possible because parking is N day . ( most of the downtown chicago hotels have crazy parking fees ) N . great location - right in front of crate and barrel on michigan ave . seriously , for the price you can ' t beat the location . N . water pressure - not so good , but it is an older hotel . N . decor was very nice and the hotel was very clean . N . yes , folks the elevators are slow and hit or miss . N . new fitness center with new equipment on the Nth floor that has a view of the city . N . easy check in and check out - we were able to check in at Nam because our flight was early and we requested it . N . the biggest downfall of this hotel is the fact that you can hear everything that is going on in the hallways or your neighbors room . some dumb guy was talking on his cell phone in the hallway at Nam and i had to open my door and tell him to shut up because i heard every word he was saying . that was the most frustrating part of all . N . hotel restaurant is very expensive and not worth the price . check out bice an italian place right down the street that was fantastic and reasonably priced . overall - i would certainly stay here again but for only a few days . there is a walgreens about N blocks away if you are worried about snacks or pop . 
what a wonderful experience . my first stay at this hotel started after midnight on N N N . i had worked over N hours and just needed to sleep before returning to work early on N N N . what a pleasant surprise to find that the prior reviews were all on the mark . i was made to feel as a guest , not any easy chore for the hotel based on my mood . to be so well treated made the stress of the day disolve . there are many reasons this hotel is so highly rated . you owe it to yourself to stay here . 
if money is no object , then i ' d recommend the hilton chicago . however , most people would be concerned with such things which is why i don ' t recommend it . this is not an inexpensive hotel to begin with , but what you don ' t initially realize is that nothing is included . internet is not included , among other things , and parking costs N per day ! ! ! i believe there was cheaper parking in the area , but we checked in so late at night that we couldn ' t spend time searching . also , the shower was plugged up and drained slowly , the hairdryer was broken and the tv remote didn ' t work . just a lot of little things wrong with the room that you ' d think they ' d check once in a while . on the bright side , the staff was courteous and helped us with some of our problems . also , the hotel is very old fashioned looking , yet updated and clean . it ' s really a beautiful hotel . overall , i just have a hard time recommending it because of what you get for the money along with the issues we had . 
the allegro is in a great location downtown in the theater district ( next to the cadillac palace theater ) and just south of state street and millennium park ( on michigan ave ) . the lobby reception area is really nice and big and is a great location for their free wine tastings in the afternoon . they also give complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings . check-in was easy and everyone was friendly . we had a king premier room and we were a little disappointed paying extra for this room . the room is very large and very clean nice , but the bathroom is small . the sink area has very little counter space which is a rarity in downtown chicago hotels . the toilet and sink are also very close together . also , we faced a brick wall and had absolutely no view out of our windows . again , for a king premier that was disappointing . overall , i would recommend the hotel , but i ' d suggest not upgrading to the supposedly nicer rooms . granted , i don ' t know how small the bathrooms are in the less expensive rooms , but it ' s hard to imagine that they could be much smaller . there is a parking lot for N for N hours on the corner of randolph and wells ( just west of the hotel ) . i ' m not sure how much valet parking costs at the hotel , but N night is a pretty good price in downtown chicago . 
stayed here for N nights in august with mom and daughter . . . . room was very nice , no problems with housekeeping . we did hear sirens , but once asleep they certainly didn ' t wake us . concierge was very helpful ! ! room was very good sized and bathroom was huge ! location was N block off of michigan -- well within walking distance to many sites . got a very reasonable rate off of expedia . would stay here again ! ! ! 
the conrad is in a great spot , a quick walk to shopping , restaurants , the river and much more . it ' s quite nice , updated and xtremely clean . the lobby area ( on the Nth floor ) is open and has a good size lounge , terrace rooftop ( in nice weather ) and a restaurant . everything you need if you don ' t have time to venture out too far . the hotel is also attached to the mall across the street . i had a corner room that had windows on two walls . the room was huge , especially for a downtown location . ample space to spread out plus a comfy chair and ottoman , and a good size work desk . the bed was incredibly comfortable and the choice of pillows make a huge difference when trying to get a perfect night ' s sleep . the bathroom was also huge and they thought of everything in case you forgot something . on my last morning , i wanted to print my boarding pass and found they have a computer kiosk near the atm . icons for all the major airlines ready to go . they really pay attention to the little details that make things convenient and extra simple for their guests . i will definitely stay at the conrad again . 
our living social deal was a fantastic value already , enhanced by the friendly efficient service and lovely surroundings of the allerton hotel . check-in was quick , even though there was a line . the bell boys got us cabs quickly and our car was retrieved in N N the time we were told to expect . i love a hotel where the rooms are not cookie-cutters , and this was the case at the allerton . my only complaints were a noisy heating system when it cycled on and less-than-luxurious towels . 
from being greeted upon arrival to the outstanding service of the housekeeping department , and one housekeeper in particular ( irene mendoza ) , we were totally satisfied . had business meetings on the Nth floor which were excellent . 
we have tried many hotels in chicago all well located and comfortable . the westin michigan has the best location almost by the lake , right on michigan avenue by its best shops . we will definitely come back . hotel lobby is nice and comfortable , rooms were spacious ( for a big city ) and beds were heavenly . coffee in the hall in the mornings is a great touch . 
we took the train into chicago for a weekend of fun and found our accomodations to be absolutely wonderful ! we walked from millenium park train station to the hotel and found it to surpass our expectations . the embassy suites is N blocks from the center of activity on michigan avenue the magnificent mile ! the hotel is nicely centered with many eateries , shops etc nearby . the room was large and very clean , the complimentary breakfast was outstanding , including made to order omlets ! the breakfast was a great way to start the busy day and the managers cocktail get together was a relaxing opportunity around Npm before heading back out for dinner ! all of the staff members were very friendly and helpful . we enjoyed every minute of our stay ! 
i ' ve stayed in several different hotels in chicago . this was the best location so far . the rooms were clean and comfortable , i really enjoyed the clean and spacious bathrooms . the staff at this hotel were very helpful , especially the doormen . i agree with the other reviewers that at least a bottle of water should be provided and the wifi should be free for all guest . stll , i highly recommend this hotel because of its excellent location and staff . 
got this room on priceline for a pretty good deal . the rooms were a little dated , but clean . the bathroom is extremely small ! and as another poster has noted the towels are not the softest . overall though , we enjoyed our stay here , especially considering we got a good deal on priceline . the location is great for shopping and we were there the first week in december , so we spent alot of time on michigan ave . loved chicago and look forward to returning . i would stay at this hotel again if i got a deal on priceline , don ' t think i would if i had to pay full price . 
we had a gold coast package which included parking and breakfast and a room on the Nth floor with a partial view of the lake . the hotel caters to business people but we were there for a vacation . the hotel was quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable . the only quibble we had was with the heat---i suspect it ' s controlled from the the front desk even though they made a big deal about how we had our own thermostat ( it never responded unless i called the front desk --- it was november and would get cold in the room ) . it ' s within easy walking distance from the visitor information center and the bus lines . the hotel staff was very helpful and the onsite restaurant bar was fine for breakfast or lunch . 
when booking our stay with the fairmont , we requested an early check in , as we wanted to ditch our luggage and get straight to the taste ! we stepped into the beautiful lobby and we checked in , but our room was not quite ready . we were told we could wait , and they would call us on a cell phone as soon as it was ready . over an hour passed by , without a phone call . as the hour and a half mark approached we decided to ask about the status of our room . apparently it had been ready for quite some time and they had forgotten to call . . . ooops ! but we quickly got over the delay . the rooms were wonderfully decorated , with large bathrooms ! we also had the most wonderful view of downtown ! if you are looking for a nice hotel near both millennium park and grant park , this is a wonderful choice ! 
when we found a great deal via travelzoo for labor day weekend , we pounced on N rooms for our family . turns out it was not just a nice hotel but the staff was super friendly and the location was quite convenient to navy pier , millenium and grant parks , the magnificent mile , and plenty of other sites that we walked to during our holiday stay . we had asked for rooms near each other on the same floor but ended up getting adjoining rooms so that was awesome . we ate in the main lobby restaurant a couple of times in the morning ( for convenience more than anything else ) and though it was just a bit pricey the food was terrific and the breakfast buffet plentiful and quite tasty . my only nit-pick is the N day for internet - c ' mon folks , that ' s a bit absurd ! ! thank goodness the parking was free as part of our booking . i would stay here again in a heartbeat . great experience . 
i recently traveled to chicago with a friend to catch a cubs game . we originally made a reservation at the marriott o ' hare directly across from this hotel on the other side of the highway . we changed our reservation and stayed at the renaissance instead since the marriott had some construction going on within the pool whirlpool areas . the check in time was speedy and the front desk employees were all pleaseant and quite upbeat . the hotel has a very spacious , modern and inviting lobby area . lots of leg room and some really comfortable sitting spots . our room was unusually large in comparison to most hotels that i have stayed at within the same general area . the room was in very good and clean condition . the bed was very comfortable and the refrigerator in the room was a great addition to the ammenities and sure kept our beverages cold . the hotel has a really spacious swimming pool and a pretty nice whirlpool as well . my only complaint was the water temperature of the whirlpool was luke warm at best . i contacted the front desk and the temperature was much better later that day . it is nice to know that complaints and feedback do actually get taken care of quickly . well anyways , this hotel is extremely convenient for travel to see a cubs game . wrigley field is no more than N minutes away . the train station is less than a block away . it cost us N each for a pass to get us to and from the ballgame . the bell captain at the hotel gave us accurate diections by train and it turned out to be a great ballgame . go cubs ! ! i make sure that you check out ginos east for some super tasty chicago style pizza . it is across the highway and maybe a N minute drive . my only complaints about this hotel would be as follows . the hotel is off a main road and there is no sign at the roadway itself . we drove right past it . there is a dark colored hotel sign at the actual entry . however , it is somewhat challenging to read and did not appear to be well lit . unlike the other reviews , i expect and anticipate being charged to park my car at a hotel in the chicago area . however , the parking structure is incredibly busy at times at the spaces are unusually narrow . make sure that you are careful opening your doors . you don ' t want to hit the car next to you . i think that flat screen tv ' s would be a welcoming touch . thats it , overall beutiful hotel and really nice time to be had . my first time at a renaissance hotel and i will absolutely be back again ! 
great location . direct access to the mall . accross from joe ' s , one of the best restaurants in town . walking distance to blue chicago for great blues . 
this was a great hotel in terms of extra perks . . . i loved the hot breakfast in the morning and never encountered long lines . the manager ' s reception in evening with snacks and drinks was a huge bonus when i had to wait until late to go to a business dinner . the hotel is in a great location , within walking distance of great restaurants . the suite offered tons of room to get work done and relax . i ordered room service , it took about N minutes , but i enjoyed a hot and delicious meal . i utilized the valet parking in the basement , and was always able to get my car out quickly and easily . my only complaints were noise related . i was on the Nrd floor and the street below gets very busy and noisy early in the morning . i could also hear my neighbors through the walls . despite these setbacks , i would still stay here again ( but maybe request a higher room ) . 
my girlfriend and i had some time to kill so we decided to stay downtown prior to a long flight out the following day and enjoy some of the chicago flavor . i was a little concerned when the doorman was absent and i wondered if i ' d have to abandon the rental car at the curb to check in but another employee at the hotel stepped up and said that the doorman was detained but he would watch our car while we checked in . we checked in with no problems at all , dropped our luggage off and left to go see the city . we actually didn ' t get a lot of time to see the property and its amenities but the staff were very helpful and the room was clean . hope to come back to enjoy some of the other highlights the hotel has to offer , it seems to be very well kept . 
this is a historic hotel and the lobby is very nice - however , once you step into your room you realize that it needs major updating . the rooms are very old and not as clean as they should be . the tvs are ancient - for the first time ever , we didn ' t even bother turning it on . it was quite far from the beds and not a flat screen . the mattresses were old and flimsy . the whole ambience of the rooms was outdated and our room was very moist - the papers in our room even became damp . would choose a different hotel if you are staying downtown . they also charge you extra if you want to use the fitness center or internet . 
what a hotel treasure just south of the loop . the rooms are well appointed and the staff is extremely friendly and courteous - so much so that i was upgraded to a suite that was large enough to have a N-person party in . the restaurant was killer - i would eat there every night if i didn ' t have to meet business associates elsewhere . and the beer selection at the bar is one i have never seen - it is a beer connoisseur ' s dream . next time you ' re in chicago , make sure you stay at the hotel blake . oh , and did i mention that it ' s a great value , too ? 
we were in chicago on the night of may N N due to amtrak having service problems as our train was N hours late . amtrak provided us lodging for the night at the chicago south loop hotel-i was a bit skeptical since this was downtown chicago but from the time my husband and i walked in the door we felt welcomed . renee at the desk went beyond our expectations at making us feel comfortable . our rooms were very spacious and very clean . i was very concerened as we were going to have to book a flight to return home to alabama due to amtrak having service interruptions between chicago new orleans-our starting point on our N week vacation . i had never flown before and needed to purchase on line tickets for the next day . renee helped me with this process and even printed our boarding passes for us . again she exemplies excellent customer service ! thank you renee for everything you did for us . 
paid N for the night on hotwire . its your typical N star hotel . room was clean , a bit small . hotels in downtown chicago can get pricey so if you can get this hotel for under N i think you ' re getting an awesome price . 
stayed for N nights in april . features include big , clean rooms with comfy beds . very good bathroom and shower . very elegant inside and out . very good location , N-N blocks from bus routes . breakfast was the highlight for this trip ( really good omelette ' s ) . dominick ' s located across the street , walgreen ' s and wine store behind the hotel . need to improve remote control did not work and was never replaced ( complaint submitted on day of arrival ) , and the sofa bed was truly designed for small kids ( no adults should be allowed to sleep there ) . otherwise , an excellent option for chicago visitors . 
great hotel , great location . i highly recommend this hotel . the beds were super comfortable and the room was quiet at night . we had a great time and would stay again . 
recently went to chicago for N nights on a business trip . could not have picked a better hotel and location . i got a room for N a night on travelzoo which was hundreds of dollars less than other hotels in the area . the front desk staff and doormen were very helpful and accommodating . i felt very comfortable as a solo female traveler . yes , the rooms were a little outdated , but spacious , clean , and comfortable . its an older boutique hotel and had more charm than generic chains in the area . i requested a room at the back of the hotel which did not face the l train . it was very quiet . at the end of my stay , the airport shuttle came a little a early and the lady at the front desk printed out my boarding pass for me and ran out to the street to give it to me . . . if you read this thank you ! they really went above and beyond . i was thrilled with the value and the location . 
stayed here with our kids as well as my brother and sister and their kids N people and N rooms overall . our visit was on the weekend before christmas . the purpose was simply to have a family get together and get some shopping done on the magnificent mile . there is probably no location better in chicago for access to the m . m . nordstroms and the rest of the downtown mall is right across the street . that and the layout of the lobby , with it ' s large open bar and other common seating areas distinguished the downtown marriott from most other large city hotels we ' ve stayed at . it made socializing in large groups easier and the older kids could come and go as they pleased while the adults relaxed with a beverage . there were several large screen tv ' s and although this wasn ' t a sports bar it made it easy to watch the nfl game that captured the attention of many of the patrons . the rooms were small and non-descript . while the pool area was fairly large and accomadating , the pool itself was small . there was a good-sized workout room with lockers and showers available as well . we also received a rate of N . N which was a terrific value compared to their normal rates . all in all it was a great experience made better with the large , welcoming lobby , bar and access to all the best chicago has to offer . 
i don ' t ask for much when i travel , a clean room and a bed i fit in ( almost N ' tall and under N lbs ) . to make sure i always have a king or queen size bed i have it in my profile and double check my confirmation . i arrived at Npm and they put me in a room with a double bed . i was eventually able to get a king in a downsized room but they never adjusted my bill . still working on this . so much for being an elite member who plans ahead . . . 
the location of this hotel is super , the doorman and the bell boys were very attentive . the only minor is that you have to pay ( N , N N hrs ) for wireless internet connection . it surprised me as we stayed in various hotels motels during our N-week trip through N states in total ( including cities like nyc and boston ) but everywhere the internet was for free . no , correction at the motelN you had to pay N , N N hours . but hey , at a nightly rate of N , - what can one expect . for the rest it was fine ! 
my daughter and i went on girl s weekend shopping trip and stayed at avenue hotel chicago . we truly loved the hotel ! everyone was friendly and helpful . the location was close to fabulous shopping ( american girl place , disney store , chanel , boss , brooks brothers to name a few ) and great restaurants . we decided to get a kid-friendly room and we were so pleased with it . the room was bright and comfy and we had a ball with the wii ! we are planning on returning closer to the holidays and will definitely stay at avenue hotel chicago again . 
kierra , irma and patrick were all helpful and attentive during our family ' s stay . helping us and making us comfortable while we attended a family funeral . 
we stayed for two nights and were very happy with the accomodations . much better than when we were here five years ago . this time we had a remodeled corner room on the Nth floor with N windows and a view . the staff was efficient and treated us great . we would definitely return for a third time . 
i have just returned from N day stay at the bw grant plaza . i was initially concerned after reading some not so positive reviews . but if you don ' t have high expectations , i . e you don ' t expect the ritz carlton , this is great a little hotel in the windy city . i stayed on the Nth floor and had pretty decent views of the city skyline and lake michigan . the rooms were clean and adequately decorated . i was there for a conference and appreciated that each room had an ironing board and iron . the heater some reviewers complained about , worked just fine in my room . in fact , i had a brand new heater ac unit . connecting to the complimentary wi-fi was a cinch . only disappointment was the lack of breakfast . the restaurant next door was rather expensive . 
we stayed at affinia hotel for N nights in N rooms . it started with the warmest welcome by andre and peter and continued during the whole week . they were always cheerful and welcome us with a smile , they suggested the best attractions and restaurants . the sevice and stuff are the best we ever had even in more luxirious hotels . the food at the hotel restaurant is the best we had during the whole week . it is perfectly located for shoping and site seeing . we will stay at affinia hotel in chicago again . thank you for making our vacation a huge success . 
my wife and i were here for only one night so did not take advantage of any of the amenities in the building . we found our room quite comfortable , clean . and well-maintained . we heard some street noise but there was no sound from adjacent rooms or the hallway . the only problem was that the clock radio was set for an hour earlier and we didn ' t notice until morning . apparently it never got set ahead for daylight saving time last spring ( this is october ) . and i could see why--i could not figure out how to change the time and most likely no one else could either . as is the case with center-city hotels , extras are not free . you pay for parking , internet service , breakfast , etc . visitors should be prepared for this . also , expect to pay extra if you want a view because most rooms are going to face other buildings . and expect big city noise sirens , garbage trucks , etc . 
my wife and i arrived early on a friday and knew we probably wouldn ' t get into our junior suite which we picked because of the " l " shaped layout on an inside corner with tons of windows as depicted on the hotel web site . when we dropped off our luggage , we were told we were upgraded to a executive suite . when we checked in later in the day , we were checked into a handicap accesable room which had a bedroom and an attached sitting room with a fold out couch which is not what we wanted . we called down but were told the hotel was full and we couldn ' t be moved . later we discovered the phone didn ' t work next to the bed and to make a call , we had to go into the bathroom and that phone kept falling off the wall . the tv remote worked when it wanted to and a movie we rented had the sound so messed up it was like watching an overdubbed karate film from the N ' s . bose system and all . then the chain came off the toilet plunger as we were departing to dinner the second night at a very bad time . had to take the back of the toilet off and stick my entire arm in the toilet basin to get it to flush . i was not happy . room service was very expensive after all the fees were added and drinks at the bar were nearly N . N each after a reasonable tip . N . N is simply too high for a scotch and a magarita unless you are in st . lucia looking at the pitons and not a kid screaming in a stroller getting his diaper changed in the bar . and the hotel has no pool and it was perfect swimming weather . there are just better options for the same money and far better options for a bit more jack . keep looking . 
my husband and i visited chicago to celebrate our Nth anniversary and stayed at this hotel . hotel indigo is in an excellent location . it ' s in a nice quiet area but within a N minute walk of shops , food , and some great bars ! staff was polite , service was great , and the room was smaller but decorated in soothing bright colors . we got a great deal on the room and they even let us check in early without any hassle . parking was right next to the hotel for N N hours , which isn ' t bad for chicago , and the valet staff was fantastic ! only downside is that there is no pool , which would have been bit of a bummer for the kids , but there are plenty of kid-friendly activities to do in the area to keep them busy ! 
i stayed here in june N for N nights . good location just off michigan ave and across the street from the drake . room we had was small , but updated with very comfortable bed ! bathroom was nice with marble tile , granite counter ( very small ) and dual shower head with rain yet sort of pain to use . breakfast in the hotel is good , but takes a while so if you are in a hurry , don ' t eat there . you can walk to all of the good shopping on michigan ave as well as walk to navy pier . vallet parking a bit pricy at N bucks a night and it takes them about N min to get your car out . highly recommend you eat at joe ' s crab for dinner and gibson ' s steak house is a must do , but you will need reservations in advance . valore was also very good for some authentic italian cuisine , and try the wit for some good bar atmosphere . if you want to use internet , they will charge you per computer , not per room . enjoy ! 
the hampton inn majestic and staff can ' t be beat for a chicago stay - short or long ! for starters , there is the delicous complimentary breakfast and the comfortably decorated rooms that utilize perfectly this historic building . then consider the convenience of being within easy walking distance of the art institute the chicago symphony the majestic theater ( same building ) as well as several other notable theaters and endless shopping and architectural wonders ! for culture or for easy sightseeing , chicago is fabulous and the hampton inn majestic is in the center of all . finally , an unbeatable restaurant suggestion aigre doux which is a relatively new restaurant and will be well rated in the new zagat . if you ' re lucky , the talented chef will wander through the dining room and have time to stop and chat ! enjoy . 
this review is more about the parking garage than the hotel experience itself . our stay at the essex was actually very good for the price . except for our vehicle damage from the parking garage , our whole chicago experience up until that point had been nearly flawless . what a disappointment after checking out . it was noon on sunday just after walking back from a church service just a few blocks away . we were feeling great about chicago , and great about the day before heading home . the damage is on the bottom and side . . . looks like the valet driver had a smaller , lower red car and turned too close to my van when parking . gave my van a nice scratch and dent with the other vehicle ' s front bumper . we were so busy filling the back of the van with suitcases that we missed the damage until we stopped for food about N minutes out of town . we called immediately . . . had to wait about N days for the claim to go through . they didn ' t ask for photos nor did they ask for much information at all so we suspected we were going to be left high and dry . basically , since we can ' t prove they did it . . . we ' re on our own to flip the bill . and since , technically , the connected parking garage is a separate business from the hotel , the hotel won t accept responsibility either . with valet parking , this should have never happened . if driving into chicago . . . do not use their parking garage ! ! you ' ll end up paying for a lot more than the hotel room . not the way to end an otherwise great trip . puts a sour note on the whole chicago experience . 
stayed here on N N N . took our two boys downtown for a night in the city . sometimes when a hotel is hip , the staff can have a ' whatever ' attitude - kind of , ' i ' m too cool for you . . . . ' but not here . the modern vibe of the radisson is complimented by a welcoming friendly staff . our room was on the Nth floor - black onyx granite floors - with an bright aqua carpet . excellent lighting , top of the line fixtures . our room had a balcony , although it was too cold out to enjoy . wonderful views of navy pier and the lake michigan . beds were comfy - N queens , rather than N double - which is hard to find . one thing we noticed is the doorways to the rooms are not right off the hallway - they are tucked back - you go down a little hallway to the doors to the rooms . this makes the rooms very quiet . no noise from the hallways at all . being a new hotel , everything is shiny and in excellent condition . the lobby is beautiful , with the long ( very long ) fireplace and comfy chairs . the lounge , bar and restaurant are modern decorated in white , gray silvery tones . we had lunch at filini - the restaurant . excellent food . sandwiches were reasonable ( around N ) but the other options were pricey for lunch . ( N- N for appy , N and up for entree - most averaging N ) . lunch for the four of us was N ( we did have a couple glasses of wine ) . our boys loved the game room ( pool table ) and N N basketball court . the gym is better equipped than any hotel we have ever stayed . . . . but it is shared with the residents of the aqua building . we were there on two occasions , and it wasn ' t crowded . steam room and sauna are also available . we really loved this hotel . then again , it is brand , spanking new . i hope that they keep up with the maintenance of the property - keeping it fresh and clean . great location -- close to the river , millennium park . only complaint -- parking . N . ouch . goes with the territory of city hotels , i know . but it still gets to me . we will definitely stay here again . 
we booked three nights in this fabulous hotel through priceline . we had a one-bedroom " presidential " suite with a lake view for N per night including breakfast . car parking was N per night , but a car wasn ' t really necessary . the staff couldn ' t be more helpful and friendly . and the restaurant " mon ami gabi " was good too . 
had a great great experience at w hotel . while checking in , i thought the tone was friendly but also full of elegance , not too familiar . the gym pool are clean , quiet well equipped . the room was spacious , the view onto lake michigan absolutely fantastic . before leaving , i wanted to buy stamps for post cards , they just took them and offered to stamp them , free of charge . i highly recommend this hotel
i was glad to be staying at the w city center instead of the usual place in chicago , as i had heard good things about the hotel . turns out there was good and bad , as follows good things included the beds ( very comfortable , although small ) , linens ( nice from the towels to the sheets and comforter ) the bliss bath products ( dreamy and lovely - i usually don ' t take the products anymore because i travel so often , but i took these ! ) , the shower head ( great water pressure ) and the personnel , who were almost all polite and cheerful . bad things included tiny tiny room ( barely could walk around in the room and the bathroom gave new meaning to the word small ) , dark furnishings which made the room seem even smaller ( expecially the dark gray , wavy drop ceiling - what ' s up with that ? ) , the woman who yelled at me during the wake up call because she couldn ' t hear me ( the phone was broken ! ! ! ) and the ridiculous cost of cocktails in the lobby bar ( N . N for a small glass of house wine and a martini ! ) . all in all , for the price paid i prefer the old standby of the allegro , which is less expensive and closer to the office where i work . 
enjoyed this hotel immensely , possibly the best and most accomodating staff of any hotel we have stayed at recently . checked in for new years eve for N nights , we were given a corner room , nice size comfortable but a bit noisy from some outside fans . contacted the front desk and they responded immediately , personally came to our room to show us another availability and moved us to a beautiful suite overlooking harry carey ' s . everyone went out of the way to make our stay comfortable and arrange dining and theatre tickets . they work closley with harry carey ' s and walked in without a reservation at N N pm new years eve , gave them a card from the hotel and we were seated immediately . tuan the bellman , joe , chris and george at the front desk were wonderful . the evening cocktail party had great food and beverage selection , the morning continental breakfast on each floor had great selection as well
i booked this hotel with a tip on deals from the trip advisor forum and got a good deal . . . after reading the reviews ( and seeing and hearing the house of blues as i arrived ) i asked for a high floor and a quiet area of the hotel . . . . i was on the Nth floor in a great room with a view of the river , the marina towers and N wacker drive one of my fav buildings in chicago . . . very convienient for my evening at the oriental seeing hair . . . and for viewing the green river on st patricks day ! ! i had a problem . . . my toilet overflowed . . . and the response was quick and clean up promt and thorough . . . . i think this is where you find out if you ' re in a good hotel with good service ! loved this hotel ! ! i
we were offered this hotel when booking our flights with travelbag . the cost for three nights over and above buying flights only was only N - how could we go wrong . however , then we read the reviews here and elsewhere and started to worry . . . . we needn ' t have . yes , rooms are not large - but not tiny and hey , you are only staying a few nights , not buying the place . bathroom very tiny but clean and with all facilities . air con worked well - good as it was cloudy but very warm and humid . room was clean and no funny smells . we are quite sensitive to tobacco smoke but didn ' t notice any in the reception hall at any time . all staff pleasant and helpful . didn ' t eat at the hotel as it was a bit pricey compared to other places . our only gripe with the hotel - and it is a teeny one , was the gift shop ( i think independently run ) where there were no prices displayed . my husband selected three postcards and they wanted N - when they were around Ncents each elsewhere this was over the top . recommendations in chicago ? l ' appetito at the bottom of the hancock tower for breakfast and also good lunches . the bean in millennium park for an interesting sculpture . hancock tower bar has good bar menu and great to watch the sun go down and all the lights come on - must be as good a view as the top floor and you don ' t pay admission ! use the ladies loo on this floor ( girl ' s only of course ) and see the most amazing view from a loo ever . potbellies near the sear ' s tower is good for lunch ( closed saturdays ) . free trolley bus rides around the city are good - but make sure you get on the free ones as some charge . navy pier great and the lake beautiful . airport shuttle not as good as other cities - pricier than a taxi for more than one . taxi was around N each way . 
my husband and i just returned form the most wonderful week at the sofitel chiago ! i just re-read many of the other reviews posted , so that i can address issues directly , and not waste everyone ' s time - bathrooms are as amazing as everyone says . great products , space , luxury upfittings . - staff was amazing with customer service , while not being at all " snooty . " - conceirge was one of the best that i have ever dealt with . " brian " was a star and should be promoted ! he was like an old friend , pointing us to great restaurants , and gently guiding us aware from the tourist traps . - room was modern , clean and comfortable . small , but perfect in every other way . i choose perfection over space . - stop sitting on the fence . book the sofitel water tower ! we are in new york just before christmas , and are staying at the sofitel there . can ' t wait to see the sister property , and this time in a suite . this may be the beginning of a long and loyal relationship ! 
had a N night stay in kingsize room on Nth floor with veiw of magnificent mile and watertower . no problem with elevator waits but never could get connected to web . got a decent rate with groupon deal . location was ideal . reasonable walking distance from the subway system with N connection from airport ( a N day pass was great deal for everything we needed and prevented high parking prices ) . lots of places close to eat . we were trying out the chicago pizza ( it is good as pizza always is to me , but not anything super special ) . walgreens in same block . very enjoyable stay . especially recomend the mayors office sponsored free tours with volunteer greeters . nobel horse theater was unusual fine in downtown chicago to those with equine interests . lots to do--will go back in warmer weather next time . was nice for us floridians to have one day of snow though
my wife and i recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the drake on a pleasure trip to chicago . aside from the " chamber-of-commerce " view up the shore of lake michigan from our fifth floor room , we made numerous visits to the concierge desk , relying on the extremely helpful and engaging staff . we made our first contact with them via cellphone , enroute to chicago to get some ideas about recreational opportunities in the central part of the city . without hesitation , andrea suggested taking a chicago river architectural boat tour . it was a perfect choice for us to spend an afternoon catching up with old friends and learn a great deal about chicago in the process . they also suggested two top notch restaurants for us , one for an early dinner before going to second city on friday night , another for an excellent italian feast on sunday . the drake is a fine old hotel with a lot of charm and history . our stay there was made nearly perfect by the hard working , friendly concierge staff . kudos to them ! 
my spouse and i needed to move out of our home for N hours while it was being " spring cleaned . " this year , we selected the hilton because they welcome dogs that are up to N pounds . our large , male airedale is over N pounds - so , he isn ' t allowed in most " dog friendly " hotels . at the very last minute , we booked a one-bedroom suite on the Nth floor ( executive floor ) . the entire experience at the hilton was excellent . from the moment that we arrived , the staff was very accommodating - especially to our dog ! they made sure that oliver had a dog bed , bowls , treats and lots of attention and praise . they even offered to walk him in the park across the street ! the suite was updated and since it was a corner ( south east ) suite , we had windows on two sides - very nice - lots of light . the bed was comfortable and well appointed with plenty of pillows . room service was very good - we ordered dinner at Npm and at N Npm it arrived , hot and well prepared . breakfast on the executive floors was excellent - nice options ( including " take away " coffee cups with lids ) and very friendly and helpful service - especially the concierge . overall , we were pleasantly surprised - we didn ' t expect much since it ' s the " old hilton " - and , since we just needed a night someplace that welcomed our dog , our expectations were pretty moderate . hilton greatly exceeded these expectations - we would highly recommend this hotel to families with kids or dogs - the hotel staff goes out of their way to make sure that you ' re welcomed . finally , i have to say , the common areas are beautiful and very grand ( especially the front , N story entrance ) . with the very reasonable rates that hilton is charging this summer , you can ' t go wrong - especially if you ' re from out-of-town - the location , across from grant park , can ' t be beat ! p . s . - be sure to check and see if you can upgrade your room rate by N night to allow for indoor , attached parking ( the usual rate ( if you don ' t include it in your room rate ) is somewhere around N night ! ) . 
ok , i have traveled extensively for N years . i have stayed in hotels from nyc , to paris , to copenhagen , etc . this summer is i stayed at the james for business . my company put us up at the intercontinental , but we have stayed at the james in the past . i decided to buck the system and pay extra to stay at the james . i checked two bags on my last day while i still had business at the mart . after meeting clients for drinks in the hotel bar , i went to get my bags . my bag with my ipad , an hermes scarf , my daytimer , gifts for my kids , hair straightener and various other items was gone . total loss about N . N . the desk clerk and hotel manager assured me that they would replace the cost of the items . they told me to wait a week and the bag might turn up . after a week i called the manager and he pushed back saying the chicago inn keepers law only holds them liable for about N . N . after getting very upset and making a stink the hotel agreed to pay N . N , a loss to of N . N . i will not return to the james . i had previously left a sweat shirt and pants in the room that they claimed they did not have . 
just returned from a three-night stay at the wyndham . everything was perfect , from ismail at the front desk to dennean ( the by request manager ) . our room was wonderful , the daily breakfast included in our package was excellent , my kids had a blast , and the service was friendly . i can ' t recommend this hotel enough and we ' re already talking about our next return . you also can ' t beat the location of this hotel . yes , there are sirens as the hotel is across the street from a hospital . however , we were on the Nth floor and it was definitely tolerable . it ' s a city . . . cities are loud . we dealt with it . basically , don ' t let that detour you from staying here . and , if you ' re not happy with something , don ' t hesitate to ask . i can honestly say that this is by far the friendliest hotel we ' ve stayed at in chicago . every employee we talked to was kind and acted like they truly cared about their job . 
we were impressed by our room at this hotel . wood and carpeting , rain shower , reasonably priced minibar , large windows , ipod dock sound system , plasma tv , hyper comfy sheets , so perfect but . . . saturday night arrived and the party started . they have a very popular nightspot at this hotel and clients that go there during their stay . so they have to guard the elevators on saturday night because there is a lot of people wanting to cut the line outside and use the inside hotel elevators . and i think that the hotel ' s clients can go back to their room from inside . . . so there was noise all night in our corridor , culminating at N N am ( we went to bed at Nam ) when a group of people arrived and spent N minutes in the corridor shouting and laughing . at some point i went to open and close my door with a bang to make them realize they were in a hotel . they shouted insanities at us through our door and continued their noise for N minutes then came back to knock violently at our door . earlier in the day another client complained to us in the elevator that the night before two men came out of the elevator at the same time he did and followed him to his room . . cautioning us to be careful . i am sorry to think and say that this hotel management ' s want to make money and be hip with a trendy nightspot at the expense of the comfort and security of their hotel customers . i will not go back to the dana for that reason only
i am in total agreement with the poster below regarding this hotels front desk service and elevators . we stayed during the same weekend and it took us over an hour to get from our room to the front desk and vice versa . when we finally did make it down we were charged for things from the mini bar we never used along with being double charged for our room at a rate higher than our original rate ! we discussed it with them and they " took care of it " later that week i found that the charge was again taken from my account ! after dealing with the billing department it has now been refunded , we will see for how long . i have stayed at many chicago hotels with my wife for pleasure and business and needless to say we will not be back . it was like pulling teeth to even get an apology from the staff for their errors . 
we just got back from a fabulous weekend stay at the w city center . we booked the w because it was close to the christmas market at daley center . the w was a short N block walk . i was a little leery when i first walked in with my N year old son , it looked young , hip and funky . however , there were wooden chess sets , connect four and checkers games sitting out even hot chocolate at check in . the rooms were spacious , clean and comfortable . there were a couple of small broken things but the staff was very apologetic and very attentive at getting them fixed . the shared spaces in the lobby is comfy and fun . a great alternative to being stuck in the room . one night we decided to go down , have a drink and play some chess . my son was sad because all the games were gone . i asked at the desk and they said someone threw all the games pieces together and they sorted through all of them so he could play . amazing customer service . the restaurant is nice and has great food . they were also very accommodating to my son . there is also water and coffee for free in the mornings , and cookies out in the afternoon . also plenty of options right outside the doors . but i cannot say enough great things about the staff ! thank you for such a wonderful stay ! 
i stayed there over halloween weekend with girlfriends and thought the hotel was fine . it was a large hotel and very busy due to its location . i liked that they had coctails for the guests from N-N , that was a nice touch , it was a small area that was packed , but it still was a bonus . the rooms weren ' t fancy , but they weren ' t bad . they were suites and big enough with a table . we ordered carry out from the resturant downstairs which worked out really well because we just wanted easy snacking and sharing and didn ' t have to buy drinks this way . the breakfast was not up to my standard . it too was crowded , and i may be a food snob , but after attempting a completley dried out omlet , cooked for N minutes ! i went for oatmeal , and that was terrible . i liked the coffee and had a banana . i understand food for the masses can be hard , but maybe less is more would bring up the quality . the lobby was pretty for the fall , the people at the front desk were nice . the other thing was the garbage . because it seemed to be a party hotel , there were pizza boxes and garbage bags everywhere , and all night and then next morning they were still there . . . maybe a few more on the overnite cleaning staff . 
the hotel burham was a welcome refuge from the bustling big city of chicago . with it ' s smaller size , beautiful renovations , comfortable rooms , excellent location and exceptionally pleasant , professional and helpful staff i would stay at the hotel burham again and recommend it to other travelers with no hesitation . this is ritz carlton treatment at prices the ' average joe ' can afford . two thumbs up for the hotel burham ! ! 
check in is not the greatest with the front desk clerks unable to crack a welcome smile while they sat at a low desk and did not even offer us a seat while we " stood around " waiting to check in . the dana is in a old renovated building . the reception is on the first floor and so you have to walk up the stairs or take a single floor elevator , cross the lobby just to get to the elevators to your room . we got a large king size room which was nice but with floor to ceiling windows it was a bit of an effort opening and closing around N blinds every morning and evening . the bathroom was a bit of a strange design with a glass panel which gave the person in the bedroom complete access to anyone using the " facility " . there was a curtain which you could leave open or closed across this glass panel , but still a very odd design feature . the location is good with easy access to a lot of local attractions and nearby restaurants . the gym is well equipped with new machines . unfortunately i did not have a chance to use the spa but it looked very nice . the metro station is located a few blocks from hotel which is really convenient and easy to use . we took a train to and from airport to avoid traffic which gets congestive . free easy to use internet access in room . the restaurant on first floor had a club atmosphere at night but sound is well contained . overall we had a good stay , but reception staff can definitely use a motivational talk . try get room on higher floor for a better view . 
we came in from the chicago suburbs for an activity in the city . the hotel was just fine for N of us . we appreciated the room safe . our room was in the back by the alley , but inspite of reviews that this was a bad location , it was actually quiet and probably better than the side with the " l " going by all the time . a panera is only a block north and west , so breakfast was easy to take care of . subway is across the street for a quick lunch , and lots of more eating choices of all prices are within walking distance . hotel a bit tired . the staff was nice . room clean . we were on the third floor so walked up and down as the elevators were a bit slow in showing up . we did not use parking as we used public transportation in and out of the city . overall i would stay here again . 
overall an excellent hotel in a great location . . the staff were very friendly and helpful . the concierge desk was excellent in assisting with information on the city and obtaining reservations . the room was very comfortable and clean . if i had to pick one minor thing to complain about we found the quality of the toilet paper not very good for a hotel of this standard . it may have something to do with the hotel or city plumbing . . apart from that a great chicago experience
as co-producers , we went to chicago with a small group from hartford , ct to see the opening of the new musical " the addams family " . it was cold in chicago that day but from the moment we were greeted at the door of the wit hotel we felt a warm welcome . everyone , from the doorman , concierge , room service , dining room staff etc , was personable , helpful and polite . even the telephone operator addressed us by name , the design of the hotel is stunning , both high concept and user-friendly . the room was spacious , clean and comfortable and the price was very reasonable for the quality . eds , west hartford , ct
definitely excellent ! our experience was not lacking in any way . my husband and i stayed at the end of march for two days . the room was excellent , very roomy , up to date decor , clean , very much up to international standards ( i ' m american but live in new zealand ) . service was great , atmosphere wonderful , i loved the selection of menus from local restaurants that you can order from and have added to your room tab . i appreciated the mini kitchen , i think that ' s something sorely lacking in american hotels and motels . we didn ' t eat at the restaurant on the premises so don ' t have comment on that . one reviewer had issues with the air conditioning the info binder in the room did mention that they turn off the heating air conditioning while you ' re out for the day , to save energy , but that can be left alone upon request , and our room had its own controls . the price was excellent , especially for what we got . and if you ' re into downtown chicago , the location doesn ' t get better than this . i feel like we got to experience a little bit of authentic chicago , not just another corporate cookie cutter hotel . next time i ' m in chicago , i ' m definitely going to book this place again . in short , no shortcomings in my opinion and i can be pretty discerning . 
i have literally traveled the world and this was by far the smallest room i have ever stayed in . the claim to N stars is laughable . the bathroom is a joke . it is so small one cannot even turn around in it . there is no mini bar , no coffee maker , no place whatsoever to do anything more than lie in bed . the tv is so close to the end of the bed that i had to sit on the bed to squeeze between them ! the pool closes at Npm , the gym costs a supplement , the ethernet cable costs N for the very basic reception , and the line at the hotel ' s reception desk is enough to turn you away . if you want to stay in a small and expensive N star hotel in downtown chicago , then this is your place . if you desire nicer accommodations , then by all means , keep searching ! ! 
i spent one night at james hotel traveling through chicago . it turned out to be my best hotel stay ever ! finally a hotel that has found the perfect balance between extremely friendly staff ( genuine and service- minded ) great rooms with modern style , excellent food ( breakfast is highly recommended ) and a perfect location . 
friendly hospitable staff , chic modern decor , great location -- N min walk to shopping on magnificent mile millennium park and it overlooks the chicago river . sign-up to become a kimpton member ( it ' s free ) and you ' ll get a discount on rates along with free wi-fi and a N credit to raid the mini bar when you check-in . also , if you become their friend on facebook , you ' ll get a complimentary bottle of wine and a sweet note . you get comfy animal print robes to wear , aveda products , an umbrella in case of rain and if you get lonely , they ' ll even bring up a goldfish to your room . concierge was friendly and gave us great suggestions . spend a little more for one of the corner rooms with the two large window seats that overlook the river . . . you won ' t regret it ! 
this es was in a good location and close to the central area of chicago a quick drive over to the navy pier although i suppose you could walk if you like . we were lucky enough to stay in the presidential suite on the top floor which was a great choice for our family of N . one bedroom had N double beds and the other had a king bed and there were N full baths . there was also an ample living room with a large l shaped couch and a very nice wet bar with a large dining area . N total flat screens . nice space . the service there was also very good . their daily breakfast area would get crazy busy everyday we were there . as would the afternoon happy hour . be there early or you ' ll have to fight in the lines or miss out . i would recommend this hotel for families . 
modern style rooms with balconies that expose the guest to great views of lakeshore east park . staff extremely accommadating , friendly and professional . fitness room enormous with lot ' s of options . rooms were squeaky clean ( including bath ) . very reasonable rates for this newer hotel in a great location . 
i travel to chicago on business at least bi-monthly . the affinia is always my hotel of choice . the location is perfect , the rooms are spacious and modern , the roof top bar is an oasis , c-house restaurant is fantastic , and most of all the staff is outstanding . the bell man welcomes me by name , the front desk is efficient and accomodating , the servers are terrific and everyone goes above and beyond to ensure i have an enjoyable stay . i reccommend this hotel with great enthuisiam . it truly is my home away from home in chicago . 
this hotel is very nice . my wife and i spent our anniversary night here , t is right in downtown chicago and there are lots of places to go nearby during day and night . the staff is very knowledgeable and the concierge desk knows just the right places for you to go . it is a high end hotel so nothing is free which is a change from the usual hotels i stay at but the prices weren ' t bad . the rooms are older looking but it is an old hotel and the decor and comfort make up for it . great place to stay when shopping or enjoying the nightlife in the city ! 
hotel is in a great location . lobby is nice . workers are great . the rooms are extremely small and tired . carpeting , paint , bathrooms are in bad shape . rooms need complete renovation . . 
the hotels locaton is wonderful , but the rooms are tiny . i have never seen hotel rooms this small in the united states . the hotel is in a beautiful historic beaux arts office building , but the room have the charm of a dorm . the bathroom only had a shower and the closet was the size of a phone booth . the television is too small to see from the bed . the bedding was cheap . room was very clean and in excellent condition . elevators were very slow and required room card to operate . the sheer size of the room made it difficult for two people to share . staff was very accommodating . 
nice hotel , good location , view from the Nth floor wasn ' t up to much but we were on a freebie so didn ' t complain . room was large and clean and bed comfortable . woman behind the desk wasn ' t that friendly or competent . it took a while to check in and i had to come back down as the key card didn ' t work first time . 
fifteen of us travelled from ireland and had the greatest pleasure of staying at the affinia ! the best hotel in chicago without a doubt ! irish people are known for our friendliness and hospitality but we have major competion here ! what a fabulous bunch of people and if i can , i will mention names , victor , daniel , erin , christopher , joel , they made our stay so unbelievable ! thanks in particular to victor who put up with our midnight antics , that is finding our keys etc , the affinia should open a hotel in ireland , we need a great hotel like it ! please let us know if you do as we ' re all in the business ! ! nicest staff you will meet , if you ever visit ireland we work in a restaurant called the oar house in howth co dublin . come visit xxxx ps victor you made our holiday love to yaxxx
popped in for weekend get-away . room obtained via hotwire . very impressed with size of the room bath . well appointed , big flat screen tv plus bose stereo , comfy bed . in the past have stayed on michigan ave ( intercon , drake ) , this location puts you in the heart of the shopping district with lots of amenities nearby . public garage across the street , valadation gives you N per day rate ( vs . N ) with in out privliges . they , like many , have gone to the free coffee in the lobby vs in-room machines - which i like as the joe is usually of better quality . only negative is no-pool , the intercon may get the nod as they have a great one ! 
my three daughters and i chose to rendezvous to chicago from boston , tucson , and co for our " girls weekend . " arriving at the " w " there was no welcome or help with the door or luggage , their lobby is a " cheap " cocktail lounge , the rooms are extremely small , furnished very distastefully and even our requested upgraded room overlooking lake michigan was a joke . the only positive experience was their concierge s understanding and willingness to help us relocate to the drake hotel . with only a few short days to share together in the exciting city of chicago , we lost half a day and months of battle fighting for reimbursement . finally , receiving credit through a credit card dispute , our " w " experience is behind us . read and believe , then book at the drake or . . . . chicago has many wonderful hotel options , but the " w " is definitely not one ! 
we use this hotel for business trips that require little hotel time and just a place to sleep . not only with the la quinta membership are the rooms always clean , modern and with a good desk , we also get good rates . the breakfast is basic but will keep you going until lunch . no social area for business meetings but the clean , cheap room makes it a useful choice for the business traveller . 
my girlfriend and i stayed three nights in a swissotel executive room during a recent chicago vacation . we have mostly very positive things to say , and would probably stay there again if we ever go to chicago . at least if we can find as good a deal as we did this time . i would like to point out some things you should be aware of N ) there ' s a lot of construction work around the swissotel . the hotel seems to be N soundproof , so that ' s no problems . but within a year or so the magnificent lake view will probably be only a memory of the past . the same goes for the view of the park area to the south . N ) make sure that you don ' t get a room right next to the elevators , since these make a lot of sound , speedy as they are . we first got room N , but had to change . no problems at all at the front desk - they seemed to be used to it . the original room had a lakefront view which was stunning . the second room overlooked the city and river , with a good look of the wrigley building . not as exciting , but still very good . beware of office workers who probably can see right into your room from a N feet distance . N ) we had an executive room which granted us access to the Nnd floor executive lounge with day-round complimentary beverage service ( non-alcoholic ) , an evening serving of hors d ' ouvres ( sorry for the spelling ) and pastries , and free internet access . also a great view . the executive status did not grant us free access to the gym , which came for a cost of N . the pool and sauna was free for all guests . N ) the restaurant and bar service on the ground floor was ok , but during our stay , the lobby was always really full of other guests . maybe since the hotel had a really good spring offer , which attracted more private guests compared to the usual business people . N ) the executive room was smaller than expected , probably a standard room , although on high floors . i would probably choose a corner room next time , which looks larger on their website . the king bed was excellent , lcd-tv really nice , and the room came with a stereo with ipod docking station as well as a really good coffee brewer . nice ! the bathroom featured both a tub and a shower and was in perfect condition . the last remark in fact goes for the whole room , the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated . N ) make sure to sign up for the club swiss gold bonus program before your stay for better front desk service and it will strengthen your chances of a free upgrade . all in all , swissotel chicago was a great experience , which i definitely would recommend . 
i stayed here for two nights with my girlfriend over the july Nth weekend . the hotel exceeded my expectations and i would definitely stay there again . pros -the rooms were well appointed and very comfortable ( the beds are extremely comfortable ) . -service was excellent from valet to front desk -sundeck had a great view and amenities looked nice although we didn ' t use them -compared to other hotels the prices for extras such as the mini bar and parking seemed reasonable cons -i didn ' t like the sliding door in the washroom , not as private as i would have liked -restaurant was overpriced for the quality of food and service ( don ' t bother with breakfast ) 
do not stay here ! ! ! our room was unsanitary and the front desk staff did not care - even the woman who identified herself as the front desk manager . this is not worth it to you no matter what the cost . 
stayed at hampton inn majestic N nights first weekend of may , N . traveling with wife and N year old son . great location . within walking distance of anything within loop . blue line and red line stops only one block away . easy to get a taxi or catch a bus . queen beds were very comfortable , rooms very clean , not huge , but adequate . employees were very friendly , always greeting with a smile and willing to chit chat . breakfast was average for this class of hotel - cereals , make your own waffle , yogurt , fruit , juices , coffee , muffins , rolls . everything was fresh . rooms were pretty quiet considering downtown location , but could hear sirens , etc . would stay here again . 
i love the conrad , the rooms are larger than most hotels in the area , the bathrooms have separate shower and tub , with plenty of granite counter top space ! we love the hotel restaurant for breakfast and the bar for a night cap . the staff is also great , so accomodating , we wanted theater tickets for the same night we arrived and had them within N minutes from the concierge . not least of all the hotel is so convenient with michigan av on one side , rush on the other , and nordstrom ' s right there . we will definitely stay there again . 
we had an issue with making a phone reservation and not receving an email confirmation . when i decided to call to confirm our reservation the afternoon of the night we were scheduled to arrive , i was told there was no reservation under my name . come to find out , an error had somehow been made and we were booked at a different hilton . we were able to come to a compromise , however . this hotel is very conveniently located downtown within walking distance of many shops , restaurants . . . . hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating . pool hottub were decent , although quite small . this was a family vacation for us and we were overall impressed with the hotel . tip park your own car for much cheaper . . . . just park near an elevator in the parking ramp . . . . it ' s the same place for valet parking ! ! 
we felt safe and comfortable . the staff was completely helpful being it was our first time in the windy city . the rooms were super clean and homey . the vallet service was also wonderful and speedy , however a little pricey for this small town girl . the location was perfect ! ! we walked to the navy pier , sears tower and there are stores and fine dining all around it . museums are only a N dollar cab ride away . i loved chicago and this hotel only made our stay better ! ! ! 
my husband and i visited chicago many times , but this time decided to bring our little dog along for a weekend get away in chicago . this hotel is conveniently located downtown near the chicago river . it is a very nice hotel , something you would choose even if you don ' t travel with your dog . only the Nnd floor allows dogs , which is too bad for dog owners , as there is no real high rise view . the hotel personnel is friendly to dogs and welcomed our dog . they also offer dog sitting if you choose to dine without your pooch . you can leave your dog in the room if you leave him crated . this hotel offers complimentary happy hour ( munchies and drinks ) and also complimentary breakfast on every floor . we had a very nice stay at this hotel and our pooch really , really enjoyed her stay . every sunday there is a " canine " cruise which was very interesting to take . an hour and a half of cruising down the chicago river and out on lake michigan . it is the same as the regular architectural cruise , except pooches are allowed . very nice ! we all had a good time . 
this hotel has some issues at the front desk . to have one person handling checkouts at prime checkout time and no backup is very regrettable . single file , one at a time , please . no , it is inexcusable . at check out today there was no one at the supervisory level available , only one desk clerk who was not up to the job . allegedly the others were " in a meeting . " the entrance to the hotel is poorly managed by the doorman with the result that guests are allowed to temporarily park hapazardly in the only entrance exit for taxis and other transport . a good property manages their front door to the house better than this one . the amount of open space in front of the hotel is very limited , which makes managing the abandonment ( even temporary ) of vehicles in that space especially critical . the signage to get from ground level to checkin is miserable . one has no idea whether to go to floor N or floor N without spending time trying to figure it out because the brass plates on the elevator do not instantly identify which floor a new guest goes to . hint checkin is on N . the restaurant is on N , but the guest services director at the desk right in front of checkin on N does not have the menu for the day . " you ' ll have to up a floor , sir , and ask the hostess for the menu . " so , just to find out what the restaurant serves one waits for an elevator , goes up an entire floor and wastes time . inexcusable bad service and poor property management because it can be fixed so easily with minor attention to detail . the area in the suite bathroom dedicated to the basin , mirror , etc is extraordinarly small , narrow and cramped . there are inadequate power outlets here . a mouse would feel hump-shouldered . there is a signficant deficiency of electrical outlets all over the entire guest room except at the writing desk , which has one extra outlet mounted on the edge . the room lamps appeared tohave three-way bulbs and many of the settings are burned out , making a guest think the entire lamp doesn ' t work until trying different combinations of the main switch at the entrance and repeatedly pushing the switch on the lamp to find the setting that is not burned out . inefficient , maddening and poor maintenance . room service menu is N hour but heavily weighted to breakfast and sandwiches . room service prices are , of course , extremely expensive . the food quality was above-average and delivered in a reasonable time period . room rates are steep for the quality delivered in the room . an inexperienced traveler may think it ' s a quality location and hotel , but there are much better properties available to the experienced business traveler and they deliver better value . the location is first-rate , however . 
we took advantage of the chicago bears package and saved hundreds of dollars . it included free valet parking , bears game tickets with excellent seats , and the room for the night . the room was extremely clean and extremely quiet . the beds were a little soft and i do think they were doubles . the room is small and the bathroom is very small , but for just a night or two , it was just fine . sometimes we had to wait a bit for the elevators . the pool is on the Nth floor and has a great outdoor deck with nice chairs and tables for relaxing . there is even a lifeguard for the pool . we ate chicago style pizza at lou malnatti ' s which was just N blocks away . get there early--it was crowded with bears fans before gametime . we had great weather and were able to walk the mile to soldier ' s field for the game . the next day we checked out but stowed our bags with the bellman and took the double decker bus tour for N a person . the bellman can give you the information . he was very helpful . the bus took us all over the place and you could get on and off all day and see the many sights . i highly recommend the double decker bus tour . my family and i hope to do the essex hotel bears package again sometime . it was very worthwhile ! 
got a last minute rate of N a night through hotels . com . requested a room with two double beds and wasn ' t disappointed . staff was very professional . food at aria was delicious . located right off of michigan avenue with prime shopping less than a block away . cabs always available in front of hotel for longer excursions . to park , enter off of columbus drive and let valet take care of it for you . all in all , an excellent choice . 
the hyatt is located on the river downtown within walking distance of the magnificent mile , many restaurants , millennium park , and navy pier . i had an Nth floor room with river view and it was much more spacious and comfortable than the allerton hotel downtown . there are two towers , which got a bit confusing trying to navigate underground to get to an adjoining office building . but there is a cozy irish pub ( o ' daddy ' s ) and the very trendy ( and pricey ) big bar , known for fancy cocktails . there is also a steakhouse that looked pretty upscale , and i didn ' t try it since i was alone . for breakfast , the lobby cafe is fast and convenient for coffee , bagels , etc . be prepared to pay for internet anywhere in the hotel . i avoided this by going pretty much anywhere else , like coffee shops , bars nearby that have free wifi . the downside i got back home and looked at the bill in more detail . i was not prepared for what the single rate was , with no extras at all . my company and i researched it to make sure i was not overcharged . what i was charged per night was nearly twice what was listed on the internet for the same room . apparently for these particular weeknights in late september , all hotels in that area were charging that much , and this was even the cheapest . there are always conferences going on in chicago , but i still don ' t know why these nights were so hot . maybe something to do with the olympics ? the upside the helpful staff . i realized on the flight home i left my cell phone in my room . i called when i got home and security found it and assured me it was in a safe . customer service took my information and made arrangements with fedex for me to have it shipped home . i opted for overnight delivery and received it right on time , intact . i was sure it was going to be broken . i was really in a panic about it getting stolen , so it was reassuring to know they were taking care of it . they are also on the go airport shuttle ' s route if you are flying in out of o ' hare . 
excellent hotel in every possible way . food was excellent and the staff was most accommodating and professional . 
my only other experience of a conrad was at the one in dublin about N years ago or so . the chicago facility was a pleasant reminder of just what a fine product the conrad brand is . location was excellent , decor subdued and tasteful , service friendly and ( generally ) helpful . my only complaint was that the staff did not seem terribly responsive to my noting that the lock on the door of my room seemed defective . someone was apparently sent to look at it , but i never received any feedback explaining the problem or why it was not fixed . 
liked this hotel as it is close to my office , and not so close to the mag mile tourist traffic area . the staff in the hotel is very friendly - when i checked in they were going thru an upgrade on their system , and doing things the manual way took a bit longer than normal , but not too bad . upon entering the hotel there was a man that " appeared vagrant " sleeping on the couch in the lobby - he didnt bother me per se , but he was bothersome looking . . . the room itself was nice - this is an older hotel and the tv , carpet , etc were actually quite fresh looking so that was a treat . the only other room issue was the bathroom - the tub had some black crust that washed away upon turning the water on so not sure where that came from . . . the shower did not work very well and there was a lot of water that came from the spout and shower , so you had to take a shower ankle bath at the same time , not enjoyable . but again , overall with these minor hiccups a moderately priced hotel and pretty decent deal for me . 
helpful and nice staff , great location ! ! would stay again , most definatelly ! 
the pros nice concierge desk , however not manned after hours . not too far from marathon departure area . the cons small rooms considering the price , paper thin walls ( baby crying next door can be heard ) , poor maintenance , low level of service from laundry ( late delivery , no efforts made to meet client requests ) , no international channels on tv
i read many of the one-star reviews and was wary about my stay at congress plaza , but i was pleasantly surprised . yes , it ' s an old building . yes , it could use some updating . yes , there were picketers at times ( though they simply went about their business of picketing ) . however , my room was very clean ( much cleaner than some places i ' ve stayed in chicago for twice the cost ) and the bed was quite comfortable . i enjoyed being in an historical building that hadn ' t been gutted and whitewashed to fit some generic standard . if you want a sparkly hotel with rooms that seem as though you are the first ever to stay in them , this isn ' t the place for you . if you like a bit of character , then i recommend it . i wish i had ponied up for a room with a view , because it looked like those would be lovely . the location is perfect and easy to get to by l train blue line from the airport . my only real complaint was that all of the reports of no truly hot water were confirmed when i took a shower . the hotel does need to update its plumbing system . 
we love this hotel . we visit the chicago area often and this hotel has it all . it is clean and the beds are great . i love the location , everything is within walking distance . i wish i had known about it sooner . we stayed at the omni hotel two years ago and we were very disappointed . the omni has a great location if you are just visiting the american girl place however the american girl is now moving locations . my recommendation is to stay at the raffaello were you are centrally located to everything ! -caroline , ohio
stayed for seven nights . the hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly and extremely helpful . the location is great . one block to the mag mile and about N blocks to the red line subway station . the only problems we had were that our room was not ready when we arrived and we were told it would be about an hour and they would call us on the cell phone when ready . we stopped back an hour and a half later and the room still was not ready . about an hour after that we still had not received a call . stopped back again and the room was still not ready . they were however able to get us into another room at that time . the other problem is that the hotel does not really have a restaurant and they do not have a cocktail lounge . the breakfast buffet room on the Nth floor is lame and overpriced . we ate there the first morning and never went back . overall a pleasant sheraton experience . philip the doorman is the best ! 
we just got back from a N night stay at this hotel and i thought it was great ! the decor is very modern , the rooms were clean with comfy beds and large walk-in showers and the staff was friendly . they had free internet in-room and we used the business center to print boarding passes before we left . the location was just a few blocks from michigan avenue , with great bus routes closeby , plus there are some good restaurants right around the block . no , the rooms aren ' t huge but our queen room had plenty of space for us . 
i stayed at the chicago monaco on halloween night N . the location is great . easy walking to shops restaurants not far from the bus stop . as usual the monacos are beautifully decorated . we enjoed excellent service an evening wine reception . the restaurant south water kitchen had served a wonderful breakfast a delightful staff . they are a pet friendly hotel as well . they offer a business center which allows free access to the internet . the rooms are a little larger than normal . i would return with out hesitation . ka snodgrass aaa travel
i spent one evening at this hotel on a business trip . the suite rooms are very spacious and the set up was good . pros convenient location to o ' hare and all state arena convenient access to trains to o ' hare and downtown chicago large glass shower business area was easy to use decent restaurants and bar areas starbucks on site cons no bathtub ( didn ' t bother me ) very hot exercise area utilitarian pool area fine for business travelers seeking exercises , wouldn ' t recommend for families good value . 
clean rooms , reasonable price , reasonably quiet - providing you get a room that doesn ' t face onto the main highway behind the building . liked the pool on the roof . its a little way out of the center , but handy for the sears tower . well served by cta metro ( N . N from airport direct to hotel ! ) and by chicago free trolleys . not much choice of resturants nearby , but hotel cafe ok for breakfast . 
enjoyed three nights at dana from august N - N . the hotel is very modern , perfectly located , clean and well priced . we managed to get it at N cdn per night . problems we encountered the room was very small and dark . we were on the backside of the hotel and the window was only a patio door . made the room depressing , but we did not spend much time in the room during the day . room was also not well positioned . the tv was facing the side of the bed , rather than at the foot . as there was no sitting area , watching tv was difficult . finally , the dana advertised that a continental breakfast was included in the price . they cancelled the breakfast starting august Nrd but failed to tell anyone . very misleading . the good part the staff is very friendly . the concierge ( aleksandra ) was extremely helpful and spot on with her restaurant recommendations . she even tried to make up for the cancelled breakfast by offering a complimentary bottle of wine from the room . by the way , the bar fridge selection in the room is good and well priced . excellent ipod speakers in the room . at this price , i would stay again , but get a room in the front of the building . 
stayed there for a week and was extremely impressed by the staff , who made this probably our best hotel stay ever . by our second day there , the doormen greeted us by name as we came and went and remembered little details about where we said we were going . the concierge was very friendly and super helpful , arranging nice tours and getting us awesome seats for a musical . the room was small , but the floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel much bigger than it was . we enjoyed the chocolate covered strawberries that were waiting for us when we got to the room . the separate tub ( it was huge ) and shower were nice , too . the restaurant had good food at suprisingly reasonable prices . the hotel location was fairly good we were able to walk to some places , but mostly took cabs . overall , though , it ' s the staff that made sutton place top notch . 
yesterday there was a huge power outage in the chicago area . all hotels were booked solid . since we are platinum premier members , i called marriott to locate a room . this was the only place available , other than downtown or gurnee ( we live on the northshore near winnetka wilmette ) . anyway , checked in with edward and received an " upgraded " room which was larger ( and we have N small kids ) . the room was super far on the other side of the hotel , and it was horrible ! it wrecked of a staleness . the carpets were filthy as my sons allergies began to startup . just awful ! i called and requested a room change . they gave us the same tired room on a different floor . i requested a " reinvented remodeled room " and the indicated that they were out . the rooms were going for N per night , but we could use points since my husband travels alot . he has been loyal to marriott for years ! when i told the manager amber ( i believe this is her name ) , she could not provide a new room . . . . so we left ! ! i told her that my family cannot sleep in that awful room and to return our points ! we operate on principal , for N , this place is substandard and nothing even close to marriott standards . and to use reward points doesn ' t matter ---my husband earned those points through travel and being away from our family , we don ' t use these arbitrarily ! for the cost of the room , one can stay in rhe same type room at the ritz or the four seasons ( for perspective ) . anyway , the hotel is very dated . reviewed the room service menu and it ' s limited and does not have a kids menu -- you have to tell room service and they will provide the options for kids . parking is N for overnight guests -- this is chicago ! i imagine that if you have a redone room and were with marriott rewards , and were flying into chicago and had business to attend to across the street , then this hotel may work . if not , look elsewhere as i cannot recommend it at all ! we did not stay here . after the episode with the manager , we checked out and decided to wing it at home . we lit candles in the dark and had cold showers this morning --- and it was still better than staying in that outdated facility that they are calling a marriott property ! ugh ! 
we stayed at the union league club for a wedding and found the accommodations to be adequate . the room was a little small but nice . the rest of the hotel could use a little updating , although the ballroom for the wedding reception was the nicest i ' ve ever been to and the reception was superb from start to finish . the bar restaurant on the Nth floor had good food and was a good value . i didn ' t care for the service charge that was tacked on to the nightly rate and parking was very expensive , although that is probably standard for this area of the city . the hotel is in a great location . there is a strict dress code and i wish that the reservations clerk had mentioned it so that we could have been prepared for brunch the next day . 
the swissotel has everything going for it and should be ranked higher . location perfect . it s right by the chicago river and it s proximity to lake shore drive , makes for a quicker cab ride to the airport or north to wrigley field . there are few buildings between the swissotel and lake michigan , making for gorgeous views , yet you are in the heart of it all . the michigan avenue bridge is only two blocks away . grant park and navy pier are also a short walk . rooms if you can swing it , get a corner suite . because the building is a triangular shape , you get a sweeping view that is absolutely stunning . a lot of windows , but nice light-tight drapes for a good nite sleep . tasteful modern decor and roomy . the bathroom and bedroom are separated by a good distance . the beds are heavenly . views from a corner suite , you can see the navy pier , millenium fountain s hourly water arch across the chicago river , lake michigan the harbor , buckingham fountain and part of millenium park . we were lucky enough to see the N Npm fireworks show from our window that are set from navy pier on the weekend . staff has that midwestern charm . the bell hops and front desk personnel are very helpful and friendly . i did not hear a peep out of housekeeping who were respectful . misc . every third floor has an ice machine . the Nth and Nth floors for example have ice . the location of the machine is in an isolated room , i m assuming to drown out the noise . it was a little creepy at night . guys won t care , women may feel a little ill at ease , but could certainly call room service . the staff is quite accommodating . in the lobby the hotel offers complimentary water , which may not sound like much , but the ice cold jugs have freshly cut fruit in them such as melon or strawberries . the restaurant in the hotel is the palm which has several locations nationwide and serves up a good steak . if you take a river architecture cruise , the guides will point out the swissotel as one of architect harry weese s triangle obsessed marvels . i was very impressed with this hotel and its staff . i m looking forward to more visits in the future and i highly recommend the swissotel to anyone traveling to chicago . 
this hotel is set in the perfect location and they must have spent months hiring all the staff . they are all so friendly and polite . the food at state and lake is amazing ! bacon burger . . . . mmmmmmmmmmmm ! from arriving with rudy in valet , then matt the best bellman i have ever seen in my N years of constant travel and hotel stays to annie at the desk that checked me in with a smile and a warm cookie ! everyone else i ran into was so approachable and friendly . but anything we had a question about or needed help with we went back to matt . he was so knowledgeable about chicago ( and the world for that matter ) and made us feel like more than just guests of a hotel . i believe we made a true friend . checkout was a breeze with onni . and we will definately make thewit a permenant chicago based home whenever we visit . rooms are very clean and so modern . everything was perfect ! 
i have stayed at the hilton right next store . these hotels are similar . parking is expensive , however . it costs N . N a day for valet parking and N if you park your own car--N . N more if you have an suv . hotel service is friendly- room is very clean . modern bathroom . 
we got really lucky on priceline and got the chicago hilton . truly a historic marvel . we were in awe when we walked in since we weren ' t expecting much . you should get a tour . we were lucky - the manager greeted us in the morning and kindly offered a personal tour . the swimming pool is very nice ( free ) and so is the gym ( N day ) . our room was just ok . the beds were small - we asked for N doubles . it caters to conventions so i think the double beds might be undersized to accommodate those who want to share rooms . also , the room was quite warm and we couldn ' t get it to cool . but this place is an experience and right across from grant park . memorable time ! 
we recently stayed at the hotel for one night in order to park and fly out of o ' hare . the hotel far exceeded our expectations . the room was nice and clean . the shuttle was waiting right outside the door and we were able to leave our car for N days . the price could not be beat . i recommend this hotel the next time you are flying out of o ' hare . 
from the moment that we arrived ( at N a . m . and after a long cold evening of travel ) , we were greeted and treated like royalty from the desk manager , milton , and staff . we three couples booked the " adventure " on travelzoo and were not sure what to expect from a hotel that was under renovation . let me tell you that the rooms , comfort of the beds , decor , snacks , attention to detail in directions , suggestions for resturants , shopping and area attractions , anything and everything that we asked of the staff , was all first class ! the preformance of ' wicked ' and devon ' s seafood resturant were supreme ! i was amazed how the staff remembered our names and welcomed us back after each outing . we can hardly wait to return to the ' family ' at the affinia ! milton made our visit extremely memorable ! thank you ! 
we stayed at the affinia because of a N deal which had to be prepaid with no cancellation refunds . the junior suite was very spacious although the furniture was a bit of a jumble . waits for elevators . had to pay for everything extra - high rates for internet , N water , N usa today , spa fees ridiculous . coffee provided in lobby until N only on weekdays . the location was great for sightseeing , but there aren ' t many restaurant options within walking distance - gino ' s east next door if you like deep dish pizza ( we don ' t ) and marcus samuelsson ' s c-chop in the hotel itself didn ' t seem like a very happening place - i ' d find a place closer to the river next time . i do have to commend them , though , for refunding a night ' s lodging when we had to come in a day late due to hurricane irene , although the people at the desk questioned it a bit on checkout ( i had called the day before we were to check in after rebooking my canceled flight hoping for an upgrade and was told we ' d be refunded despite the non refundable booking ) . also , it ' s a pet friendly hotel - nice to see dogs in the elevator . 
to begin with i made the mistake of booking through an internet booking site , thus paying N more than most of the guests for the same or lesser rooms . my fault , not the hotel ' s , but it doesn ' t help . while the website advises that the hotel is " close to union station " it is in fact a full mile away . check-in was awful we arrived around noon and were allowed to store our bags until the Npm check-in time , about which they were very strict by Npm , the lobby was filled with over N people who had arrived at various times during the afternoon but were not permitted to check in until exactly Npm . the rooms have no irons or ironing boards no mini bar no microwave things you ' d get standard even at a much cheaper roadside location . each room had a radiator and an air conditioning unit build into the window such that the window could not be opened this became a problem during the night when the power in the room failed in the stifling heat . the desk clerk responded to my complaint that the circuits were overloaded and nothing could be done . that ' s probably true the overhead light switch in the room sparked when i switched it ! at one point during the day at least one of the elevators got stuck and a guest had to climb out . the free " high-speed " internet is so slow that a short video would take close to an hour to download . the shelf over the sink in our bathroom was broken , leaving absolutely no place to store toothbrushes , etc . water pressure in the shower was poor ( although we were on a high floor in this N-storey building ) . we expected a complimentary continental breakfast , as their website advertised this , but when we got there , they told us they ' d stopped doing that - although that ' s one of the features i ' d paid for . the location is excellent - a block from the cta red line and a block or so from buckingham fountain - in a very noisy but busy and safe area of the city . despite the check-in fiasco and their inability to fix the power outages , the staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful . the " fully equipped " business center consisted of one computer and a non-functioning printer . this place was so much cheaper than anything else in the city , i should have realized it was too good to be true . i ' d recommend it , because for the difference in price i ' d volunteer to suffer . it ' s a glorified hostel , and if you can deal with that , this place is ok . 
we stayed here for four nights after getting a good deal on lastminute . com and honestly could not fault it in anyway , the staff were pleasent and courteous ( the concierge in particular was helpful in booking us a river cruise ) , with check in swift and hassle free , we had a spacious partial river view room with an extremely comfortable bed and an excellent power shower , we were room only so cannot comment on the hotel food but einstiens bagels is only a block away and was very reasonable for breakfast . in terms of location we got a blue line train from terminal N at o ' hare straight into park and lake ( about Nmins ) and the hotel was only a Nminute walk away , about N minutes walks you to the mag mile one way and to the shops of north state street the other ( filenes , old navy , macys etc ) . the house of blues was just across the road which is a must see and there are plenty of bars and restaurants in close proximity
this hotel was absolutely perfect ! i traveled with two of my good friends and we got a great rate for a fairly large room ! we had a king sized bed and a sofabed and two large tvs a stereo . it was clean , and the staff was friendly and helpful . after we checked in , they called to make sure the room was okay ! the location was also perfect not even N minutes from michigan avenue and within easy walking distance of navy pier ! the room ended up being N split N way ! i would recommend this to anyone staying in chicago . 
we stayed here for N nights recently and had a fantastic trip . the hotel ' s location is the biggest plus--so close to so many amazing restaurants and lots of great shopping . the free breakfast and supper were a huge hit with our N kids , although it was quite busy , especially at breakfast time . however , there was always lots of food being replenished . the pool was a big hit with our kids , and they didn ' t complain at all about the temperature . staff was helpful and friendly , the rooms were very clean and spacious . the kitchenette with full fridge , microwave , dishwasher etc . was great ! parking is expensive , but so are all the chicago hotels downtown . we will definitely go back here . 
the lobby was really clean and looked very much more high quality than i expected for the price . upon arriving at our room it appeared to be clean and included a refrigerator . there was a small sitting area with two small couches and double beds , which was perfect since we were not really close to public transportation . typically i like to stay closer to the trains , but parking was free and there is not much going on in this neighborhood so i probably won ' t recommend walking last at night alone for the average tourist . 
the room ( king loft ) , the library , the coffee bar , the books , the games , the public express room service , the pump room , the pump room photos , the bicycles , the neighborhood and most of all the friendly , helpful and happy staff ! all earned our love from hello . will return again and again . 
first time visit to the ritz carlton chicago , travel with wife and N kids . we had N deluxe adjoing rooms , very confortable beds ( four seasons bed ) , good size rooms , ample bathroom with premium amenities . service at the highest standard - four seasons - always with a smile and ready to help . the lobby area has a beautiful water fountain that provides serenity and peace while having breakfast nearby or enjoying a drink in the bar , also next to the fountain . the hotel is on top of a mall with N stores , with a few restaurants and deli ' s in the base floor . everything is close to the hotel , restaurants , bestbuy , american girl store . its like being in Nth ave n . y . , without the noise and hasle of n . y . , very quiet city with nice and respectful people . we enjoyed the ritz carlton and would recommend to friends and family . 
i stayed at the affinia during the weekend of january Nth and january Nth . this was a very wonderful hotel . the front desk staff was wonderful and always curtious and polite . just about everytime i either left the hotel or came into the hotel the front desk called me by name and even remembered where i was coming from ! ! this may be a bit different then the experience others had , but i stayed in the penthouse suite . it was quite nice and had everything one would need for a great stay . as you can see from the pictures i had a private balcony , livingroom , very large bathroom with both soaking tub and N person shower and a nice sized bedroom with king sized bed . the views were breathtaking and i purposly left all the blinds open at night so i could sleep under the city lights . now , don ' t get me wrong , some of the furnishings were a bit outdated and not brand new , but i really didn ' t care much about that . the service and location make up for that easily ! and that brings me to my next point about this hotel . the location ! you are one block off of michigan ave right next to nordstrom . it is a short walk to water tower place and the chicago river . this hotel was everything i expected and more ! if you are thinking whether or not to stay at this hotel i would highly advise you trying it out . let me point out one thing though . this isn ' t a super fancy dancy hotel , but you aren ' t paying through the nose for a room either . if you are going downtown and want to stay off the strip for a reasonable price , this hotel is for you ! the service will be great and the room will suit your needs fine . 
i read mostly good reviews about this place and i agree . i know , the rooms are small . so what ? i guess they should advertise this on their website or something . because of you take the room size out of the equation , everything else is above expectations . i mean even the room size is not a big deal , granted we don ' t have any kids and did not have a lot of luggage . but i mean if you go there and you know you most likely are going to have a smaller room then it ' s not such a big deal . from the moment you walk into the hotel you feel the difference , the smell , feel and look of everything is really well thought out . check in was nice and quick . our room was wonderful , it ' s nicely decorated , i loved the new bed and linen , i loved the desk and tv . there was something special about that room . the bathroom was again on the small side of things but still very nice . i liked it . they don ' t have coffee in the room but they have complimentary coffee in the lobby all morning long . if you ' re reading this review you know the hotel is in a good location . there is a parking right across the street on clark street that is N dollars for N hours . not bad for chicago . i got this hotel on priceline but i will not hesitate to book it again without priceline in the future . i am looking forward to trying their spa with my wife . go to the hotel felix , you won ' t regret it . 
i love the suite because you get the additional room . tvs in both the living room and bedroom , not that we used them so much , but nice to have . the complimentary buffet makes the morning so easy . the food was good and there was a good variety . the doorman and concierge were great help ! 
this hotel has an excellent location on chicago ' s golden mile and is within reach of all the major sites , especially the main shopping area . i stayed in the historic tower on one of the upper floors in february N . the water pressure is not great so high up , and it took about Nmin to fill the bath-if you like baths ! otherwise the room was comfortable and very clean . however , it was obviously partitioned off from a larger area with the usual problems of sound insulation from the room next door . the room was clean and reasonably well decorated , but in a rather N-Ns style with heavy drapes and large furniture needed e . g . to contain a large screen old style crt tv . the hotel has a really serious swimming pool ( at least N yds long ) which is kept well and appears to be in the original Ns ( ? ) decor-it is really a great place . the pool is free to guests , although the fitness room if used costs extra . the standard of service in the hotel was excellent , staff were always polite and seemed to observe the rule that the guest was always right . i had a cheap deal on this hotel as a result of a large conference block booking-around N dollars a night and for this it was a good deal . i guess such rates would only apply to such large block bookings , but if you can get a good deal , i would recommend staying here-especially if you like swimming ! . if not , and you are looking for more style , more modern decor etc you should consider other nearby places-the sheraton looked swankier-but probably much more expensive ? 
the beds are soo comfortable . travel quite often and i count these beds as one of only two hotels i have stayed in that have had beds this comfy . couldn ' t beat the view either . looking right at the hancock building out our window . didn ' t interact with staff much but the little we did was helpful . they even provided bandaids for my poor feet after buying new sandals ) very clean , very quiet . have recommended this hotel to family members already . only downside was that the breakfast options were a bit pricey for us , but plenty of options just a stroll down the street . 
unfortunately this trip was to attend a funeral , so it wasn ' t the best of circumstances . but thanks to the reviews on this site , we picked the holiday inn-midway airport . what a nice hotel ! new , very clean , and the service was outstanding . we called for extra hangars and pillows and they were delivered to our room within N minutes . and then the front desk phoned to make sure we had received what we requested . we were very impressed . the beds were very comfortable and the rooms were large . nice big flat screen tv with free hbo and a lot of other channels . small heated swimming pool and nice exercise room . our only criticism was of the in-hotel restaurant . the food was pretty awful there . but after our first experience , we found other restaurants very close by , so it was not really inconvenient . overall , a very pleasant stay . 
wow . . . a hard one to review . bbb rating was good . reviews were iffy due to some complaints . however , i decided to book anyway due to higher rates at other hotels during a sold out time period . i received a wholesale rate through resorts plus international even though the area was busy . the only complaint i have is the rooms were a little out dated . but the staff were friendly and accomodating . 
i stayed here the week of the insane heat wave that hit much of the us in july . i think it was N during the day , and in the Ns at night . my room was on the very top floor in the old tower , and the ac couldn ' t keep up . i had the thermostat set at N , and it was probably closer to N in the room . i mentioned this to the staff several times during my stay , and they temporarily fixed it twice , but i just gave up . the hallways to my room were oppressively hot . aside from the temperature issues , the hotel was great and i would definitely stay there again . the location is great , tons of bars and restaurants near by . 
i am a frequent traveler and hilton honors member . i normally stay at the hilton palmer house but wanted to be near northwestern so opted for the hilton suites . i was pleasantly surprised with my stay given reviews i had read prior to booking . the staff was very friendly . my suite was on an upper floor , very clean and i was happy with the size and layout . the bedroom , bathroom and living room area were all completely separate rooms with doors . i did not eat at the restaurant or go up to the pool so cannot comment regarding the other amenities . it was nice in the morning to have a small coffee shop available in the lobby area . i would stay here again and would recommend it to others , especially those with children for the price . 
i stayed for one night in october on the first leg of my multi city trip . as my plans had changed at almost the last minute i hadn ' t had a chance to notify the hotel that i was cutting my trip short . when i confirmed this at check in the desk clerk immediately asked if there was something they could do to change my mind . i explained that my trip plans had changed and he then offered me the choice of two rooms that were available , making a recommendation as to which he thought was best . this turned out to be a room in the west tower which is by far the quietest room choice . i made my way to my room and pretty much instantly ordered room service . this arrived within N mins and when i requested an additional condiment this was bought back up within N mins . the rooms are a good size with comfortable beds and pillows you literally sink into . the location is excellent for me as my office is within a ten minute walk . it s also within minutes of the magnificent mile for anyone looking to shop . my one disappointment was the fact there is an additional charge for wifi . 
i was surprised after all the horrible reviews to see that the hotel wasn ' t a complete hole . my brother booked the hotel , and i checked here to see how it rated . i was expecting to come into a rediculously bad room , but it was just more of a joke than anything . the bathroom is about the size of the closet , the bed was too close to the dresser , and you couldn ' t open it , and the stairs were closed . other than that , it wasn ' t too bad ! the rooms were fairly clean ( dusty , but tidy at least ) and the bed was comfortable . considering we were doing a lot of sight-seeing and were hardly at the hotel , it was perfect . 
hi friends i stayed for one night at the congress plaza hotel the weekend of may the Nst , i will explain why we only stayed one night later . after reading all of the reviews i was soooo scared of staying at the congress . i expected bugs , no a c , a dirty bathroom , dirty bed . . . i expected yuckiness to the Nth power . needless to say , i saw none of it . we had a lake view king on the Nth floor . the view was great ! the room and bathroom were clean . the park was across the street . the floors were clean . flat screen tv on the wall . the elevator doors look original . looks like where the rat pack might have stayed . it is not modern there is no hd tv it does not have floor to ceiling windows . it is not swanky or posh the only reson we stayed on night was because of the picketers . my bf just couldn ' t do it . crossing the picket line felt horrible . they have been picketing for N years . if you google it you will see why . so , if you want a clean room , clean bed , clean bathroom , a tv , a view of the lake and park and don ' t mind crossing the picket line . then stay here . but because of the picketers i just can not recommend it . 
this hotel is located minutes from the midway airport . it is staffed by very friendly and helpful people . it was so nice to be able to start the day well rested and full . the beds were comfortable and the rooms were quiet . the breakfast was very tasty and had many choices . 
this hotel is in a good location close to the lake and parks . also easy to get to the red and orange line . the rooms are comfortable but the cooling and heating system is not regulated by the guest . it is one unit and the hotel decides if ac should be on . i checked in at N Npm and the room was N degrees . it was like that most days out of my N day stay . at night with the window open ( and all the street noise coming in ) the room would get down to N maybe . 
we stayed at the palomar in chicago for two nights in early july and then returned for an additional night after some days in michigan . it is a very nice hotel with a decent swimming pool and is conveniently located . it was easy to come in from the airport on the subway , though unfortunately the station nearby was working on it ' s escalator , making coming up the stairs with heavy luggage a problem . the staff at the front desk is super helpful and recommended several good restaurants and sightseeing options . they booked our architectural boat tour , which was one of the best things we did in chicago . we would definitely stay there again . 
big fancy conference type hotel , maybe about N blocks from michigan ave -easily walkable to shopping . we stayed in the higher floors , the room was very clean and modern for the most part . no mini fridge but ice machine nearby . the room provided a bottle of water but i didn ' t touch it since i would imagine they they would charge you N for it ? didn ' t have time for swimming but the indoor lap pool looked decent although the water looked a little merky . . there is a pool towel boy check in desk before you enter so you would think he would have time to check the chemicals once in awhile . nice outdoor deck looking over the river . tip free internet at the internet cafe down in the basement area . a block across from the hotel is a domicks grocery , walgreens , amc theater game place , its about a N minute walk to the navy pier and millinium park . i would suggest taking a cab to millinium park-its walkable but had to go through a long under pass and it smelled like urine and it was creepy . 
this was my Nrd or Nth stay at the talbott . i really do love this hotel . the location is only N blocks from the chicago state red line stop . N blocks from michigan ave and the hancock tower . over the last N years since i started staying at the talbott when in chicago , i feel the value for the dollar isn ' t as good as it was . but this is understandable . it is a great hotel , so is on par with other hotels charging similar rates . you used to get passes to the fitness formula club ( gold coast location ) a short few blocks away , but now they give you passes to the equinox club which is actually closer on michigan ave . however , the fitness formula club was way better . it was much bigger and had a huge selection of equipment . so this is disappointing . free internet is very reliable . never once had any problem . next time i ' m in chicago , even though i love the talbott , i think i might try something else since the same money can buy other hotels rated just as high on trip advisor . 
second stay at a chicago hilton this summer . both rooms were dark with cost saver yellow lighting looked out at other rooms , not at the street or sky were huge but only partially furnished and were ice cold - even with air cond off . lobby ' s nice , room ' s not up to par with pleasant rooms at other hotels . these rooms will make you want to go home for sure . 
i really enjoyed staying at this hotel . it offered everything i was looking for and made my stay in chicago one of the best . thank you for the lovely accomodations ! 
the only issue we had with this hotel was the valet . it ' s a zoo getting the car . great room for a great price on hotwire . com . 
my finance i visited chicago over labor day weekend stayed at the hyatt regency . i have stayed there before it ' s a very trendy hotel . the location is great ( even though it ' s on the south side of the river ) , with the ability to walk to grant park , down michigan avenue , and to navy pier . positives location , price ( if booked on-line in advance ) , rooms are updated have a mini frig w a fully stocked bar , an air purifier , comfortable beds , and the restuarants bars w in the hotel . the big bar is great for happy hour , however , very , very , trendy after N Npm . there ' s a convenience store next to the hotel and during the winter when it ' s cold , snowy , etc . ( the underground walkways are very convenient to get around in a several block area ) . improvement no pool or spa . you have to walk to the gym pay N a day to use it . the hip-hop bar on the weekends in the lobby with a long line mostly mid-N year olds , makes the hotel lobby extremely loud ( i feel sorry for the front desk staff ) . i recommend it to business travelers weekend get aways . not good for kids . 
decided to cruise down to chi-town for a long weekend as a little road trip to get out of this crazy city . checked with my friends on tripadvisor and found the majestic mile hampton that looked pretty good and was priced pretty reasonably . . . so i booked it . upon arriving , w monroe street was under some crazy renovation . . . so watch the pot holes and exposed manhole covers . the valet guys are really confusing but kind of funny and nice . expect to pay N night for valet ( or parking anywhere in the city ) with in and out priveledges . there are homeless people sleeping in the parking garage so they make you take out your electronics and sign a waiver . . . i guess it ' s expected anywhere in any major metro city . we were in a nice N sports car and didn ' t have any problems so i wouldn ' t worry about it . reception is on the Nth floor - angel at the front desk is awesome . . . really nice ! checking is a breeze and we stayed on the Nth floor . not much of a view since we faced an office building but i didn ' t really care . room is neat with pumpkin orange walls with high ceilings ( N ft ? ) . we had N double beds with a N inch samsung flat screen tv . did the bed bug test and didn ' t see anything . the mattresses actually looked pretty new but were a little too soft for my liking . sheets were crisp and clean and unsoiled . bathrooms are clean with a granite counter top and nice hot and powerful shower . no complains on the room . . . nothing fancy but super clean , comfortable , and nice . fitness centre is ' meh ' . it ' s free N N . . . N treadmills , N eliptical , a cable station , and balance ball . they all have tvs built in so bring your headphones or use theirs with ' supplied ear covers ' that were out of stock when i was there . i think that ' s kind of nasty anyway . . . who wants to wear some sweaty old headphones ? dang . . . ice is available on every floor and drink vending machines are on every Nnd floor . free breakfast ! a lot of free breakfasts are i but this one is decent . there are waffles , potatoes , bacon , english muffins , toast , cheese danishes , apple danishes , fresh fruit , apples , bananas , oranges , raisin bran , cheerios , another bran cereal , blueberry muffins , decaf , robust , regular coffee , and herbal teas . also a juice dispencer with apple , orange , and a mango guava juice ( i think ) . a nice perk is that coffee , tea , and some fruit is available complimentary N N in the lobby . i made some good use of it ! there are also pre-bagged breakfasts at the front desk if you have to grab one to go . two computers located in the lobby for internet access but i didn ' t use them since there is free wifi . overall , i ' d totally recommend . clean , safe , convenient . . . can ' t ask for more . to put the cherry on the sundae , it ' s right downtown . you can walk to food , the skydeck , willis tower , and many of the other attractions . and if you like shopping , you can get to state street where shopping starts . there is a forever N right on the corner followed by a t-mobile , huge macy ' s , cartier , disney store , puma . . . . chicago is a great city that everyone should see . it ' s layed out nicely with fantastic architecture and such a great character to it . the stuffed deep dish pizza is a must . only caution is that in the downtown area on friday and saturday there are a lot of people asking for money at dawn and later . . . . but even so , i felt safe . 
my wife and i stayed at the palmer house for one night . we scored a great rate through hotwire . we checked in on a friday afternoon . i expected the hotel to be busy since it was a holiday weekend . in addition , college football was at soldier field . the line at registration was fairly long . but it moved quickly . our room was on the Nth floor . the floor was recently rennovated . overall , the room was nice . it had two beds and two bathrooms . nice linens . what i don ' t understand is why the bathroom fixtures were of holiday inn quality . the rest of the room was done at the palmer house level of quality . kind of weird . we contacted housekeeping to have the linens changed due to allergies . they were changed promptly . the hotel is still undergoing rennovation . overall , another nice stay at the palmer house . 
i would like to compliment the talbott hotel after my incredible stay . my room was beautiful , roomy and luxurious . the talbott staff was very friendly , especially office manager sarah yates , who answered every question and went out of her way to make my stay one of the best in chicago . this truly is a five star hotel with an excellent location . i will make this hotel , my hotel of choice in chicago and you should too . 
the great location is my favorite aspect of this hotel . just steps off michigan ave . , and very near the red line subway . staff was friendly , rooms are small , but the sheets and pillows are heavenly . bathroom is also nice . they even had books in the room for you to look at . would definitely stay again . 
my friend and i stayed here for lollapalooza and it was in such a great location close to many attractions . we were able to walk wherever we wanted and the parking garage was close as well as much cheaper than many others . our first night we were in a suite and wow ! but when we had to go back to our original room it was very nice as well . all staff was helpful and there were no issues even with our late check in . for the location the price was also affordable . our only complaint was the overly firm beds . all in all , we ' d definitely stay here again ! 
great location for sightseeing , shopping , nightlife , anything important for the windy city ! the staff is more than nice , happy to give advice , help with the luggage and birng additional cosmetics in a minute . well . . . i guess the best luck that we have ever had when bidding for the hotel . i would recommend it for both business and private trips . 
my daughter and i came for a very short weekend and i was hoping for a carefree one . although i made it clear i was a light sleeper and needed a quiet area of the hotel , we ended up in a corner that allowed me absolutely no sleep with all the ambulances blaring all night . no problem . . . they adjusted my bill and moved us to a different corner and higher floor for the second night . perfection ! room service dinner the first night was not a success and the room smelled from the fish most of the night . no problem . . . they adjusted the bill and the second night we ordered their ' design your own ' pizza . don ' t miss it ! without reservation i say it is the best i ' ve had anywhere ! if you require a firmer bed , do ask for the boards they are happy to place under the mattresses . finally , believe the concierge when he she says it would be prudent to order your shedd aquarium tickets online . i was absolutely astounded by the N N-mile long line when we got there . of course , with tickets in hand , we walked right in . finally , do sign up ( free ) for the select member program as this allows you free in-room internet access as well as a choice of beverages ( and a lovely cup of yogurt ) delivered to your room ( free ) in the morning . i can ' t wait to come back ! 
stayed recently for a conference and paid usN per nite . i had requested beforehand for , and was assured at reception upon check-in that my room was one of the newer , upgraded ones . but turned out to be an old room . as it was already past midnite , i didn ' t bother to complain . i shall not repeat the other reviewers ' comments about the smallness of the room and toilet , shocking lack of room fridge ( for a purportedly premier property ) ) and general tiredness of the property . if i do return to chicago , which is a great city , i really see no compelling reason to stay in the palmer again . 
my husband and i were in the palmer house hilton for five nights . i had read some reveiws previous to our stay . boy , were they off the money . don ' t fall for the negative reviews you see . the staff and concierges were wonderful . they were attentive to our needs and fulfilled them prefectly . the hotel was always very clean as well as our room . the beds were so comfy it was like being at home with our high count sheets and feather bed . the sound of the trains was faint so that was not an issue . the hotel was situated to alot of sights as well as resturants . we also walked to alot of places . if i ever go back to chicago i will definetly choose the famous palmer house hilton again . 
stayed at the hotel monaco for the very first time the weekend of november N . having never heard anything - good or bad - about the property , i had no idea what to expect . what a delight ! everything was excellent all the way around - from the decor , the impeccable maid service , friendly front desk staff ( thanks , mark ! ) , delicious food in the restaurant , great downtown location to the goldfish friend to keep us company ! as a suburbanite who often commutes into the city for events and a way to escape , i ' ve found a real gem that i ' ll visit again . be sure to sign up for their intouch loyalty program . this free membership gave us N towards a mini-bar purchase as well as free internet . 
just spent N nights at the hard rock on a wistle stop tour in chicago at the start of a tour around the usa . the best thing about the hotel is the location which is just over the river on michigan ave only a couple of hundreds yards form all the serious shopping on the magnificant mile . the rooms are of a good size for a city centre hotel and are pretty comfortable as long as you stay as high as you can due to road noise . the room service food was poor and quite expensive but if you avoid this your stay will be enjoyable . one thing me wife did not like was the fact that the rooms are poorly lit so it made getting ready ( make up etc ) a little tricky . things to make sure you experince in chicago include the shedd aquarium , the river tour and the cheesecake factory below hancock tower . 
stayed at the hyatt for business . took a cab to hotel . don ' t know if the subway will get you close to hotel . checked in went smooth even thought hotel was very busy . i had a room with a wonderful view of the river and the navy pier . room was clean and bed comfortable . this is a business hotel during the week , but can see how it would be a good tourist hotel also . i like the service and prompt attention . you can check out via phone , menu on tv or down at the the desk . there are limited places to eat around hotel but walk down wacker and there are lots of choices . ask at the front desk . there is an underground area with all kinds of places to eat . . starbucks , fast food , etc . connected to the west tower . enjoyed my stay and would return . 
i was very happy with the room and the N service they had . i think this is a great deal , if you ' re on the budget , and need mainly sleeping amenities . the parking is free , and the lot is fenced . we walked everywhere , to the hancock and the navy pier . kids had a blast for breakfast at the next door mcdonalds - which is the cleanest , and the best one i ' ve ever been to - with the museum and interactive stuff they have . the N hrs walgreens , two blocks down , was also very useful . this location is great , the kids were so excited to be in the middle of everything . in spite of the winter weather it was easy to have them walking around . there was an attraction on each block they walked on , like rainforest cafe , or the portillo ' s and barnelli ' s restaurant . the purpose for our chicago visit was to visit the downtown and the museums , and this hotel was awesome for our needs . 
found hotel on internet . looked up reviews and decided to book it . excellent choice . great location , easy to get around . comfortable room , especially bed . staff very helpful . conciege makes great suggestions re whats happening in the city . we took his advice and had a great time , both at a restaurant and show . will definately be back too chicago and will stay again at same millenium knickerbocker hotel . 
before arriving the room was booked on priceline at a very reasonable rate . the hotel was very centrally located downtown in a quiet neibourhood . hotel has free wi-fi for guests . the only downfall of this hotel is the size of the rooms . even for a single business traveler , i found the room to be very small . 
we stayed at the hotel for N nights , wish it could have been longer . to my surprise , i was upgraded to a N bedroom suite . . . the only thing missing was a view of lake michigan , but we managed ) my hilton honors membership allowed us access to the executive lounge , which had a stunning view of lake michigan . breakfast in the lounge offered thier famous ' muselli ' along with some wonderful pastries and baked goods , cereals , cheses , lox . . too much to mention ! the lounge is also open for cocktails ( for a fee ) and light appetizers . there seemed to be ample seating available and there was a computer there also . our room was more than spacious . when we opened the door to our room , we were in the foyer , roughly N feet long and N feet wide . on the right side was our living room with a wet bar . . . . there was no way this could be confused with a ' sitting area ' , this truly was a living room with full sofa and lounge chairs . the wet bar was a nice surpise and well used ! our bedroom contained an extrememly comfortable huge bed and another sofa . tv ' s in both rooms . the bathroom reflects the era when the hotel was built . . . walk in shower , soaking tub , mirrored sink , scale , the toilet seemed odd ( especially with the flush handle coming out of the wall ) but all worked well . i was thrilled to have such great housekeepers on our floor . they always took time to say hello and asked if we needed anything . they were getting the suite across the hall from us ready and offered a quick peak at the view of lake michigan . . . nice view , but our room had a seperate bedroom . . . . then . . . one of them said . . . . " go down to the end of the hall in about a half hour , we ' re getting another suite ready and winked . " turns out they were cleaning the " lady dianna " suite . . . . . . and . . . . . i got a sneak peak at that too ! ! ! ! there are so many surprises this hotel holds . the evelators have benches . . . never saw that before ! oh my gosh , our room had a doorbell ! we left something in our car and asked if we could get it out . . turned out it is a N minute walk to the garage . so , when you choose valet parking , please know your car is not being parked in the garage next to the hotel , but down the street . . . the valets were great and deserve any appreciation you can give them . the drake is one of those hotels that will remain in my thoughts as one i can not wait to go back too . yes , having a suite was lovely , but i would not mind having a standard room as well . thank you to all who made our short stay so memorable . 
stayed at the mk with my wife and teenage son for N nights august N -N , N and must say we experienced none of the problems mentioned in earlier negative reviews . we called ahead and requested a room with N beds which was ready even though we arrived at N pm . that was the start of some extremely courteous and efficient service we received from every member of the hotel staff . the room itself was a decent size -- we never felt crowded in it -- and was very clean and tastefully decorated . the beds were comfortable , climate controls worked well and water pressure in the shower was very good . the only negative was our bathroom was extremely small -- you felt cramped even with one person in it . otherwise we thought the rest of the hotel was in very good condition considering its age . the lobby area was nice and the martini bar and adjoining lounge area were very pleasant places to relax and enjoy a drink . plus the location is just great -- a short walk to the oak street beach , water tower place , rush street and dozens of bars , restaurants and shops . we paid N on priceline and thought that was a great value . we have been to chicago on several occasions but our stay at the millenium knickerbocker made this one an especially pleasant trip . we would definitely stay there again . 
my husband and i stayed N nights at the allerton and it has been a great experience , the staff has been very nice and helpful , they upgraded us to a suite , which was grand , the bed was absolutely very confortable . the location is just perfect , in the middle of magnificent mile , were all the shops are and very close to everything . i would definitely reccomend this hotel for a nice stay in chicago . 
just got back from chicago . stayed one night at the hotel N . the hotel is nice , but older . the room was big by chicago standards and it felt lacking in in decor . the views out of our Nth floor windows were fantastic . then there was the bed . i called it the fred flinstone bed . it was so hard and uncomfortable that i was unable to sleep all night . additionally , in the morning my back hurt . i mean really hurt . i thought the location was great , but i doubt i would ever stay here again . 
the allegro was great , very laid back and fun , but with enough quality amenities . my family went on a euro trip in the spring , and got a chance to stay in some pretty nice suites . my kids commented that they liked the allegro way better than any of the euro hotels which included the hilton waldorf london , swissotel istanbul , and westin excelsior rome . pretty cool . really beyond expectations based on how " depriciated " the property became in the final years of the hotel bismark era . the mattress furniture were in good shape , the attitude of staff was superb , and gift bags for kids and dog was a nice touch . i just wish i visited chicago more often . . . 
i have stayed at the james and will continue to stay there . room service is great . toiletries are the best . the vibe is similar to that of chicago , upbeat and unpretentious . trader joe ' s across the street for vino and extra water . i love having a nightcap in the bar or starting the night there . 
the comfort suites in chicago is a perfect location along the magnificint mile . it is close to shops and great restaurants . the room itself was great with a wonderful view of the river and some of the beautiful architecture that chicago is so famous for . one of my colleagues mentioned that she had a washer and dryer in her room . i actually thought she was joking until i opened up one of the doors in my bedroom and saw for myself that there truly was a washer and dryer . how convenient for travellers ! the staff was extremely helpful and i was especially impressed with the doormen . they always had a smile to greet you with and it was obvious they valued exceptional customer service . 
first off , my wife selected this hotel , not only because of its great historic nature , but , because they assured her that , i , who am disabled , would be amply accommodated during my stay , especially for my birthday . well , this did not happen ! our room was located extremely far from the elevators and was very difficult to orient in it was set up very poorly ! it was not at all " disabled friendly " ! for example , no curbside ramps , no commplimentory valet parking for the disabled , which incidentally i had to have valet parking was a whopping N . N a night ! additionally , no cable or satalite tv , no free internet access , no wet bar , no free coffee in the room , not even free continetal breakfast was offered . a mandatory N gratuity for room service is automatically added to room service charges . and this is only a few of the disappointments there are many others ! " pet friendly " wrong , there was a steath and outrageous N . N fee added to the room rate , if you possess a pet this was never mentioned until we checked-in ! we opted to spend good money ( N . N a night ) hoping to be catered to , but all we experienced , was a money sucking vacuum cleaner , with strong suction ! everywhere we turned , there was some sort of charge ! on a positive note , the hotel had comfortable beds . overall , i will never stay here again and i strongly do not recommend this hotel , especially , if you are disabled . chicago has myriads of fine hotels that do not fleece you opt to choose them ! highly disillusioned , robert f . 
 " luxury boutique , " " personalized service " and " spectacular setting " are not just words in the hotel ' s promotional materials , they are a " lifestyle " at the sutton place . they say it is impossible to make a second ' first impression ' and the staff at the front door , the concierge desk and the front desk are genius at accomplishing this . their warmth and hospitality made us feel like we were truly wanted the first time and every time we walked in and out the front door during our stay . david sowell , general manager , and jennifer pfeiffer , director of sales and marketing , were so gracious to meet . our stay was more than marvelous . thank you . 
stayed at swissotel the weekend of oct . Nth . the hotel is in a great location sort of in the middle between millennium park art institute and the shops on michigan avenue . we were able to walk everywhere and even to the train stop , which is maybe N blocks away . at night , it was too cold to walk , so we took cabs , even to places only N mile away . the hotel was simple , clean and didn ' t try to be too trendy or over the top , with mostly business travelers . the double room was spacious and clean . 
we stayed at this hotel for a conference . we were given an accessible room with a " roll-in shower " without a divider between shower floor -- we soon learned this meant a giant puddle in the middle of the bathroom floor that didn ' t dry the entire day . this room would be better used for someone with actual need for accessible accommodations . the room was small and dark , with a dismal view of an alley . but all this isn ' t unexpected for a city hotel what really rankled were the outrageous charges for every single amenity that by all rights should be included in a luxury hotel . internet access was N day ( ! ! is this N ? ) , the daily use of gym cost the same amount ( ! ! ! ) , and i was charged a N handling fee for a package i received at the hotel -- which wasn ' t even delivered to my room i had to actually walk over to shipping to pay for the privilege of being handed my package . it ' s truly disappointing that a landmark hotel should so gracelessly charge for basic amenities . the hotel showed signs of past splendor , but is now just a fancily wallpapered cash cow . staying at a modest holiday inn express , with free internet , gym and breakfast , would have been better . shame on you , hilton . 
despite mixed reviews on this site , my stay here has been wonderful . the staff is courteous and helpful . rooms are small but lovely . meeting rooms were great and internet was complimentary for our group . arrived mid- morning , asked for early check in and a room with a view and was graciously given both !
