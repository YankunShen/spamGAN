i have stayed at this property several times , the hotel is located in south chicago area , at the convention center . staff was friendly . i asked for , and was given a room with a city view , up high . the room i had was handicap-able , so i think it was a bit different the the rest . the elevators were fast and efficient , the property was clean . N computers are offered in the lobby to print airline documents . the internet in rooms was slow , but useful . not certain if i will be charged for it or not ? my only negative is that there are no in room safes . i called and was told that i could keep my valuables in the safe behind the front desk ? ? odd for a hotel ? ? who wants to wait in a lines to access cash , or personal property ? the red line subway is about a N block walk , safe by day . check out the shark chicken fish takeout restaurant close by , great catfish ! ! 
it ' s conveniently located right next to one of the theaters that ' s playing wicked . so the eccentrically decorated room i had was a bit smaller than it appeared on the hotel site ' s photos . my room did not have a great view , it ' s facing other tall buildings , but it was quiet . it does have modern amenitiy like the flat screen tv , very comfortable bed , toiletries from aveda , and an alarm clock radio that you can hook up your ipod to . the downside is i had trouble finding an outlet to plug my laptop and charge my phone . the closet is very small . this hotel has been around for a while even with it ' s modern amenities , but for some reason i just got the creeps especially when someone told me the hotel was part of the haunted tour . . i didn ' t see anything unusual . overall , it ' s not too shabby . 
every moment of our stay here was wonderful . . . . the staff is very welcoming and helpful , the hotel in every detail is beautiful . . . we loved our stay here ! they have a complimentary driver who will take you anywhere in the city you would like to go , which is a real treat ! the rooms that we had adjoined and were very spacious ( one had a fireplace ) and the bathrooms were gorgeous no detail has been overlooked ! we also used the workout area which is also very well done with great equipment . thank you , elysian for coming to chicago and giving us a world class place to stay . . . we will definately come back . 
this hotel is not really my style . it is very contemporary , but the beds are so very comfortable . . . . so that ' s great . the " living room " about blew my teen kids away . they think that it ' s the bomb . what i have loved so far . . . . . chris the guy out front who helped us bring up our bags . he ' s awesome and friendly . . . . made friends with my son and even called us to tell my son that they were filming the new batman downstairs and that he should come down and watch the filming . that was cool . we got to see " gotham " police dept . cars on the street . apparently , they ' ll be filming all night . i also forgot my computer power cable and jeff , the concierge , called around and helped me find one . that was a godsend . i ' m working on my master ' s thesis and really would have been in bad shape without it . all in all , this is not a great shopping destination hotel , but we ' re easy walking distance to lollapalooza and thus the art museum and theatre district . very comfortable . very nice . p . s . thanks w staff . you ' ve made this a nice experience . 
so many positive reviews of this hotel from people who have never before contributed to tripadvisor ? you can t help but wonder if they re written by never-stay college students for N a pop . so is the elysian that good ? frankly , after our may stay , i would travel back to chicago from australia just to revisit this hotel . we still reminisce about our N night stay at the elysian - a nostalgic conversation prompted this review . fantastic location . despite the rigorous no-tipping policy , the service is extraordinary consistently uber-friendly , helpful and efficient . door staff offer umbrellas at the suggestion of rain , jump to provide the free hotel town car service whenever possible . restaurant staff , noting the presence of a noisy group of diners , quickly offer a table in a quiet corner . the spa delivered the best pedicure of my life . gym staff offer evian water as you rack up your treadmill miles . our premier gold coast suite was subtle and gorgeous , with excellent flat screen tvs , cosy fire-place , fabulous wardrobe space and gi-normous marble bathroom only suggestion for improvement would be outdoor furniture on the terrace . housekeeping was perfect , the bathroom always squeaky clean . great free wi-fi . room service menu was a bit minimalist for my taste . after a delectable mexican dinner at salpicon and hilarity at second city , we stopped by the hotel bar for a night-cap . snug , elegant , romantically dim , with generous yet non-intrusive service we enjoyed excellent cocktails at bernard s bar . ( the next day i unsuccessfully tried to discover the ingredients of mine on the internet i think it contained lavender ? ) absolutely recommend this hotel ! 
i made my reservation at the whitehall hotel on expedia . com . when i arrived , cecelia at the front desk informed me that they had not received any notice of the reservation from expedia . i placed a call and the representative at expedia kept me waiting nearly an hour before he was able to determine that an error in their computer system was causing the e-faxed reservation confirmations to not be sent properly to hotels . cecelia was very patient and helpful . she also upgraded us to a beautiful suite even though the hotel was not at fault . she is a wonderful example of what hospitality really means and i will definitely be returning to the whitehall . 
my fiancee and i booked a room at the knickerbocker and just returned . we had room N , which had a king size bed and a partial view of the beach . this hotel is not as bad as people on this website say it is . i was concerned after reading some reviews , but when we arrived i realized that some people are just way too picky . i didn ' t feel the hotel was " disgusting " as some other reviewers thought . here are some highlights room - the room was decent sized and had a very comfortable king size bed . the decorations are a little weird , but i feel like it adds to the character of this hotel . the bathroom is small , but for one person at a time it is fine . the shower worked really nice and the soaps and shampoos included were good quality . considering how old the hotel is , i feel the rooms are in very good condition . lobby - the lobby is large with a really nice bar attached . the drinks were pricey though at about N for a rum and coke . we didn ' t go to the hotel restaurant , but it looked like it is very reasonably priced . staff - the front desk staff , concierge , and bell hops were all very friendly and accommodating . the concierge even helped us find the address for a bar we were looking for . we had no problems at all . location - absolutely perfect . less than one block from michigan avenue and the hancock building and only about two blocks from water tower place . it is close to the beach too . also , tons of restaurants were within walking distance , including ditka ' s . parking - we parked directly across the street at the parking garage right next to the drake . they charged N per day , but it ' s better than the N per day that the hotel charges . overall , we had a great stay at the knickerbocker and we would stay there again . 
at about N night for N people ( breakfast included ) , this was undeniably an excellent deal . the location is prime , and the room was well-designed and comfortably held our entire family . the free cocktail each evening was nice the nibbles were decent ( an unfortunate sea of styrofoam cups , however ) . however , the much vaunted " cooked to order breakfast " was a chaotic , unpleasant ordeal each morning . we felt like cattle waiting to be served at the trough . there was insufficient seating , and the entire environment reeked of make-shift disposable ( ugly folding tables chairs , ugly plastic trays , and again a miserable waste of styrofoam cups ) . dread of the breakfast pandemonium would cause hesitation in whether to stay at this hotel again . it is a shame , as so much of the hotel has good things to offer . 
unless you don ' t care about service , it is non-existent behind the front desk . i was staying at the hotel felix with my wife and N kids . " can i have adjoining rooms ? " " no sir they are all accounted for . " " ok , can i have a room w two double beds that are near my room ? " " no sir , they are all accounted for . " " i am traveling with N kids , what would you like me to do ? " no reply . all rooms that were left for us were one queen bed and no adjoining rooms . meanwhile it was N pm and this was a very early check in . at this point we decided we could not stay and sat on the couch to discuss our next move . after another few minutes a woman who was also behind the front desk walked over to us and whispered , " i got you a king bed in one room and a queen in another and they are adjoining " " wonderful , we will take it ! ! " the rooms were very clean and small , but that is to be expected in a boutique hotel . when we put the air conditioning on in one of the rooms it made a noise so loud that we couldn ' t hear our tv in the second room . we called down and a maintenance man was sent up . he said the problem was the condenser and there was not much he could do . he spent about N minutes in our room but could not fix it . he left and said he would be back in a few minutes . he came back and said that he could try to reset the unti . he spent another N N hour with us and reset the unit to no avail . " sorry , nothing we can do , but we could switch your room " obviously not , it took long enough to get adjoining rooms . " so the unit cannot be fixed ? " " nope , but i can give you a free movie " great , i have an air conditioner that is so loud that i can ' t hear the tv and for that inconvenience i can have a free movie that i won ' t be able to hear . great ! so my child decides to watch avatar . he blasts the tv in his room and then it is time to go to dinner so he needs to pause the tv . we go to dinner and then come back to the room and he tries to watch his movie again . cannot find it anywhere to resume play . so , the hotel sends up the same maintenance guy . he spends another N N hour with us to try to resume the movie . he cant figure it out . " you will just have to order it again " " ok , will that be complimentary ? " " no , you will have to pay for that " thats all i got . had a fantastic weekend in chicago . stay there all the time . have never had such poor service , which is very surprising giving the amount of competition that exists . 
i loved this hotel . i first stayed in hotel indigo in atlanta , ga , and loved it so i figured i ' d give it another shot . this one did not disappoint . the location is a bit far from downtown , but you ' re right by the l , so it ' s really not bad . the beds are amazingly comfortable , the decor is bright and fresh , the rooms are fairly spacious ( although a small bathroom ) . the service was ok . they were not rude at all , but no overly nice either . i would definitely stay in this hotel again if i were headed back to chicago . ) 
we stayed here for the following reasons N . free chicago parking N . free shuttle to train station at midway N . points per night were N , N on starwood the employees were extremely friendly and cooperative , the shuttle drivers and front desk bent over backwards to give you anything you needed . my basic complaint with the property is that it needs a good makeover . double beds in two bedded rooms are too small for this man and his wife , " we got little or no sleep " . not that we shouldn ' t lose at least N pounds between the two of us , but i do prefer queen beds in two bedded rooms . the room itself was tidy , but needed updating . certainly nothing to keep me away from it . the hvac system was noisy and did not keep the temperature very steady , we spent the night either too hot or too cold -- very little sleep for either of us . the tv didn ' t work most of the time we were there , we would have moved rooms but weren ' t in the room enough to bother with that . two free computers and printers in the lobby to use for guests were very convenient . parking is free here , so we were able to leave our car and use public transportation to get around town at N for a two day transit pass . shuttle service was near immediate every time we needed it . they gave us a number to call when we were approaching the train station to let them know you needed picked up . 
we stayed N nights and were extremely pleased with the accommodations and service we received . we were able to check in N Nam which was a relief ( reg checkin was Npm ) . rooms were fantastic and we were given a great view of the city overlooking the riverwalk . fitness center is great also . one disappointment no pool jacuzzi . 
absolutely awesome hotel ! i had the pleasure at staying at this hotel on short notice . the staff , specifically ms . jackie , and ms . regina provided great service . i flew in from washington , d . c . and my family failed to find a place for me to stay . cslh found a way to help me at the most difficult time . once i got to my room , everything was well laid out , the room was very clean , and you the climate , as well as the freshness of the room was very nice . the attitude of every member of the staff was very friendly and professional . i will certainly comeback to this hotel ! ! you cant beat the price ! this is where you want to sleep tonight . . . trust me ! 
the front desk agents are incredibly helpful , courteous , knowledgeable and truly love what they do . if you get the pleasure to stay here - i would ask for matt by name . he was so helpful to me . he gave me the inside scoop of millennium park and the surrounding area . speaking of the area - it is right on the chicago river , just a nice stroll down ( literally ) to michigan avenue . in between millennium park and the wrigley building . 
very nice hotel , but the bed was pretty hard . large bathroom , big room , huge closet and okey location . . shopping on michigan avenue was walkable . i was there aug , N-N , N and the weather was pleasant enough to walk the magnificent mile . the carpeting on the Nst floor could use some cleaning though . weekend breakfast buffet was N . i ended up having a croissant and coffee in the lobby which was excellent and only N . ordered room service the day i arrived and the pizza was awful . since i was starving and the cost was N , i ate it anyway . staff was very friendly . when i did go to the gift shop , it was closed and the sign said the employee would return in N minutes . . i never went back . overall , this was an okey hotel . i do admit though , it did not meet the expectations of what i have frequently read about fairmont hotels . 
we just returned from a four night stay at the the seneca . i booked this trip through a travelzoo promotion ( N night for deluxe suite ) before i read any trip advisor reviews . since it was a non-refundable rate , there was no turning back . the exterior and interior of the hotel are full of charm and the staff is very polite and helpful . though the elevators are small , they exude the character of the period and were always available when called . we arrived way before check-in and our luggage was safely stored and the hotel staff advised us of the best way to get to our desired locations . our luggage was promptly delivered to our Nth floor room with a hotel provided baby bed upon check-in . the room was a deluxe suite which included a bedroom , bathroom , two walk-in closets , living room , dining area with table for four and full-size kitchen with everything you need if you want to cook . the space was just right for our family of five with the exception of the bathroom . it was very small . the overall decor was extremely dated but everything was clean . the two closets are a waste however , one was so large that it served as bedroom for the baby . there were no black-out curtains in either room , so we were up with the sun . our floor had a very clean , coin operated washer and dryer which ended up coming in handy after a couple of baby accidents . there is a small but efficient gym on the top floor with about N machines and free weights . everyday i was in there , it was being cleaned . there were always fresh towels to use and a full water cooler as well as a flat screen tv . also on the top floor is a beautiful and underused roof deck . i don ' t know if you can see the navy pier fireworks from there but it is worth trying . if i were to travel to chicago again with my family , i would definitely stay here again . the location was perfect , the price was right and we had plenty of space in our room . if i were to go with just my husband , i would probably stay somewhere a little more luxurious . all in all , this was a budget and family friendly hotel . 
had booked the room earlier in the year requesting early check-in . arrived , told room wasn ' t ready . my daughter had to change in the bathroom to attend conference . upon return to the hotel later in the afternoon , the room we were given was double booked . had to wait while they moved that gentleman out and recleaned the room . staff is indifferent . for the price charged for the room , the hotel is quite plain , the inconvenience - never stay here again . willing to pay more for a nicer , more friendly place
we stayed at the hotel allegro when we recently visited chicago to see the musical , wicked . the trendy boutique hotel had been recommended by several friends , and it was miles from ordinary but steps from everything . allegro is located in the theater area and near one of the el stations it was only a block and a half to traverse before making it to the property . friendly bellmen escorted us in , and we ascended the staircase to the second level to check in ( we discovered the nearby elevator later ) . the lobby reminded us of a contemporary mod Ns motif with red velvet couches , oversized midnight blue chairs and modern light fixtures . dark wood covered the walls and was paired with a large , checkerboard carpet in brown and cream . the front desk staff was welcoming , explaining the business center , fitness area that i truly thought we would use and the surrounding areas . this lobby also serves as the locale where free unlimited wine flows during the wine hour , each evening from N-N p . m . the concierge is also located on this floor . visiting hotel allegro marked one of the few times that i have used hotel hair products . all aveda products were available and the small bathroom had a deep bathtub and marble countertops . the hotel itself is updated from an older building , so the rooms are not large according to today s standards . we had enough space , and the rooms were carefully decorated in chocolate and salmon with accents of gold and light green . in an armoire , the expansive mini bar was stocked with a small refrigerator and dry goods area contained anything from red bull to snacks and even hangover remedies . a cd player was available as well . the closet housed an iron and ironing board , but by no means was this closet large , even to the smallest of munchkinlanders . the encore liquid lounge had a groovy feel with upbeat tempos . we appreciated the wicked-themed martinis such as the lollypop kid , making for an even better night of theater . people from all walks ( literally there was a race that weekend ) stopped in for drinks before or after the theater , on the way to dinner or as a nightcap . the bartenders were extremely attentive , even on the busiest nights . food may also be purchased . N chicago is the adjacent , on-site restaurant serving breakfast , lunch and dinner . allegro s amenities stretched from leopard print robes delivered on request to a complimentary yoga basket to use while watching the yoga station on television . we saw plenty of pets during our stay . allegro s pet friendly policy is actually a good one - there is no weight limit and furry creatures can even book their own happy tails hotel package . our only complaint was not even the hotel s fault . a gaggle of teenagers stayed on our floor for a bat mitzvah and did not sleep much during the night , which meant that we had the privilege of enjoying their noise . the walls are definitely thin , although our room on the sixth floor overlooking the el did not have any street noise . the convenient location did prove to be in the middle of everything , even a parade . as we were in chicago during memorial day weekend , the parade was gearing up just as we were leaving our hotel and we were able to enjoy it before moving on to nearby shopping on state street and michigan avenue . we walked to both areas , but michigan avenue might merit a cab ride home , depending on the amount of shopping completed . also nearby is the new millennium park , grant park , the art institute , tons of dining and more . we would definitely go back . it was the perfect complement to a weekend of culture in chicago . 
i stayed here in december of N for a convention at mccormick place . location couldn ' t have been better , never had to walk outside to get to the conference . the room was nice , with a nice view of the lake ( i was on the Nth floor , not facing the city ) . overall , the room was clean , but there were minor things that would have made it better - what appeared to be a coffee stain in the carpet , some mior touchup in the paint in the bathroom . also , the heating was finicky , although it worked fine overall ( blew cool air when it reached temperature instead of shutting off at times ) . the iron looked hardly used , but could have used replacement . the restaurants on site were pretty good , especially liked shor . they a resort-priced , but right on target for what i ' ve seen in chicago price-wise . there is a metra station right next to the hotel , and the N cta train runs right in front ot the hyatt to michigan avenue , so although the location isn ' t necessarily in the heart of downtown , it ' s very accessible with public transportation . the service at the hotel was very good . every staff member i had dealings with treated me very well , and made me feel welcome . i absolutely will stay he again when i return next year . on a final note , the bed at this hotel was among the most comforatble i have ever slept in , including my own bed at home . i highly recommend this place . 
palomar ' s location on state street near illinois is central to all of chicago ' s best . staff here treats you royally from check-in to check-out . our room wasspotless and oversized and the hotel has a rooftop lap pool and state of the art fitness center . an evening social of wine along with delicious flatbreads is served from N to N in a beautiful street level room with horizontal fireplace and cozy chairs and decorative allure . morning coffee and tea is available early each day . one thing i might suggest is a complimentary breakfast along with the coffee since this area is a gathering place and a light bite along with morning coffee would be most appreciated . on anothewr note , palomar ' s restaurant sable has a fine dining reputation whcih we will be sure to check out at our next stay . 
this was our first time at this residence inn and our weekend stay was great . we know the area well . we love all the action in the river north section of town . the room was large with a bedroom , sitting room and kitchen . it was super clean with all the amenities . we had five people in the sitting room for a visit and we could have held N more . the price was very reasonable ( even though chicago rates are getting pretty high ) . a great quality to price ratio . the staff was extremely friendly and helpful without getting " in your face " . we ' ll definitely be back . 
having stayed in a few kimpton hotels , we decided to try the new palomar in chicago for a family weekend . the location is great , a few blocks from michigan ave . , walking distance to theaters and wonderful restaurants . the staff was very friendly and didn ' t not ignore the kids as is the case at many " hip boutique " hotels . they were given goody bags , with colored pencils , yoyos etc . everything needed to keep a " bored " kid busy while waiting for dinner , the yoyos were in constant use on our walks around the city . the room was a true one bedroom suite with ample couch room for the two kids . the bathroom was glorious , one of the largest bathtubs i have ever seen ! as for the restaurant and bar , the bar has one of the best cocktail menus , more of a book , i have ever seen . defining hand crafted . the only meal we eat at the hotel was a breakfast , which was good , but the service was very slow , possibly due to the fact that is was sunday morning at opening time . we would highly recommend this kimpton property , it is now our first choice for weekend getaways in chicago . 
it was not a bad hotel , but i will not ever stay again . i believed the other reviews , and took a chance . though people may have mentioned some good things , there were so many small things that were not good , they all added up . they list a dvd player in each room . when we were put on hold about the missing player , the recording they play as you wait , boasted about the dvd players in each room . we were told the owners got rid of them . they also got rid of the coffee pots ! there are no raised floor bottoms on the shower , so an extra drain is in front of the toilet , for the water . water flows freely all over the bathroom floor under the shower curtain . the tv was on the far right of the room , though the N beds are in the middle . tv was in a little cubby area , not good for viewing . the fridge was so small , it only has enough room for the mini-bar items . if you want to use it , you have to remove all the pay stuff , and have the bar items take up nearly all of the limited counter space . elevators barely held N people and our luggage . no joke . N person max , and no room for luggage with N ! hot elevator temp . smallest lobby i have ever seen . about the size of my great room and kitchen . the main lobby being a great room , and the coffee area like my kitchen . . air conditioning in the lobby and halls were none , or limited . concierge never answered my emails sent N days before my trip . location was good , but there are better at this price . rooms were clean , bedding was great . robes were shown in photos . no robes . no vending machines of any kind . lobby offers free coffee and water . ice only on every other floor . staff was friendly . we had to change rooms . Nst room had a garbage dumpster outside our window , and was old , odd shaped , and poorly arranged . . second room had a nicer view , and was newer . Nnd room also had better tv placement . tvs were flat screen , hd . the channels however , were not hd , so we had to adjust the screen width so we did not have to watch everything stretched . all rooms are not equal . old room had a huge bathroom , huge like a locker room . very odd . . nicer Nnd room had a tiny tiny bathroom , but it did have a ledge to stop the water . it only had a shower door though . . no soap dish in the showers . no hook or ring for a hand towel . no cup in the bathroom . both bathrooms had an odd placement for the bath towels . right above the toilet paper . unless you folded your towels in , they covered the toilet paper . carpet was like kitchen carpet , flat and a little stained , though clean . N rocks glasses at the bar , but no cup to brush your teeth . bathroom scale and remote both needed new batteries . maids were quiet and courteous . other guests were also quiet and courteous . one thing i will list as a deal breaker though , was the air conditioning . in both of our rooms , the air was a dial thermostat . ( a dial like an . am radio ) the air in both rooms was set at N degrees . this is the lowest setting . my guess was it was around N to N degrees in the room , with no way to go lower . not horribly hot , but never refreshingly cool by any measure . they claimed the Nnd room had updated or recently cleaned air vents , filters , etc . . but it was the same . there is no reason whatsoever to choose this hotel over any other . i hope my words have a ring of truth , as i tried to mention good as well as not so good . not bad , just not good . the N dollar a day internet is really too much . many chicago hotels are free internet , and the ones who charge range from N-N dollars . also , you have to get a code every N hours for the internet . we take a trip to chicago every year , for the past N or N yrs . different hotel every time . this is my Nst review of any chicago downtown hotel . i d never been disappointed before . we ve never stayed at the hyatt , or hilton . we always stay at mid-priced chains . our Nst so-called boutique , and our last . 
for me , this is the best location in chicago . you are on state street with a view of the river and can walk within a few minutes to the theater district or michigan ave for some shopping . the service at this hotel is what you would expect for the price - first rate . the rooms are comfortable , nicely decorated , and most offer a good view . from our room we could see the river , the chicago theatre , and the wrigley building . this hotel is pricey , but worth it . on our stay , we were on the Nth floor and had only two problems . first , there were some guests who were a bit loud in the hallway . i called the front desk and security came to quiet them immediately ( both times ) . the hotel can ' t keep guests from being a bit loud while enjoying themselves , but they did all they could to keep them quiet after receiving complaints , so i appreciated that . the second problem was that there were a lot of sirens in the city and we could hear them from our room . i ' ve stayed in chicago many times and have experienced the same problem at all hotels , so there isn ' t anything that can be done about that . just ask for a room as high up as you can get , but even the top floor won ' t keep you from hearing sirens . parking is steep , but there are plenty of self-park garages nearby , so choose one of those to save a few dollars , if you are interested . 
great location , great service , great rooms ! i would definitely stay here again . 
i ' m a chicago native ( tho ' moved away in ' N ) and went " home " for a weekend with my husband to visit friends . this hotel was perfect . the location was great . . . basically dearborn and division . we took the cta for N each from midway airport to the hotel . went smoothly except for a few flights of stairs with luggage . if you ' re a bit adventurous , the cta ' s definitely a value ! the hotel ' s style reminded me of an upscale hotel that you ' d find in a european city . . . rooms are small , but the decorating was " edgy " in a very cool way . granite counter tops in the bathrooms , pergo flooring in the room with an area rug , one wall was covered with huge blueberry wallpaper . ( yes , like someone took a photo of a basket of just-washed blueberries , and blew it up into a wall-sized photograph ! ) linens and bedding were pristine . room was very clean . only drawback was that room was located directly across from the elevator and we could hear folks chattin ' while waiting and the " ding " when the elevator arrived . staff was friendly and helpful , phone system was easy to use ( voice mail wake up calls ) . we did not eat there . ( hotel has a limited breakfast menu , but what they had looked appetizing and the seating area looked clean and , again , had that cool decorating thing goin ' on . ) had breakfast a few doors down at Nrd coast cafe--also highly recommend the selection there is more of a bacon eggs , bigger breakfast type thing . " mother ' s " ( a fairly well-known bar ) was around the corner . lots of fun . . . sang ' til N Nam with the rest of the folks at the bar . crowd was about N years younger than we were , but they didn ' t seemed bothered by us old folks ( we ' re in our forties ) . the wait staff there was pleasant , even at that hour , and since mother ' s had only popcorn to eat , our waitress suggested we run across the street , pick up a pizza and bring it back in ! we had a ball . . . 
my wife and i needed a hotel downtown to stay at while we celebrated our N year anniversary . we stayed downtown on our wedding night , so we wanted to stay downtown again . but it was the week of a huge music festival and prices were skyhigh . so we searched and found a great price online for the whitehall . we knew nothing about it , but looked it up on tripadvisor ( as we always do ) . many people had good , and some bad things to say about the hotel . . . but our experience was all good . first , great location . blocks away from the hancock building , shopping , great food . . . and everything is in walking distance . second , the hotel is classically beautiful and clean . finally , they treated us well . we had a problem with our air conditioner , they fixed it quickly . when they found out it was our anniversary , they upgraded us . we were thrilled with our whole experience and would recomend it highly . 
i always enjoy staying at this hotel in the heart of chicago ' s magnificent mile for business . i have stayed here a few times and just have to write to say i hate that small bathroom ! the door is in the way and the tissue ( this time around ) was not a hook , just placed on the bathroom lid ! mind you , that is probably not the best place for it . otherwise , the hotel was fine . 
our son ' s entry into the chicago marathon presented the opportunity for a short visit to chicago . a four day reservation was arranged cheerfully and without difficulty . our arrival through o ' hare international two days prior to the marathon gave adequate time to settle-in and to gain a perspective on hotel facilities and navigation around the city . catching the train from o ' hare delivered us within three blocks from our hotel . the hotel proved to be an ideal location as a launch pad for touring the city and for short foot-bound excursions to many nearby attractions . the hotel is within blocks of ground transportation and was a short distance to many critical waypoints along the marathon route . when coming " home " to the hotel we always received a friendly and courteous greeting from the hotel staff . room service was equally cordial and helpful . the rooms were spacious and sparkling clean . the hotel ' s breakfast buffets were great as were the extended facilities . we would recommend this hotel to family and friends and will return at our earliest convenience . 
we made our reservation using priceline name your price and save N . N off the expedia rate . the hotel is very convenient to the attractions we wanted to see . it sits right on the chicago river and if you get a room on the north end of the west tower you will have a great view of the chicago river and lake michigan . houllihan ' s restaurant is one block to the west and has a great breakfast bar that is considerably less than the hotel restaurant . the staff are friendly , the room was quiet , the bed was great and we slept well . buy your own water from the N-eleven store N blocks west . the bottled water in the room is very expensive . don ' t open the refrigerator unless you want to be charged for using it . 
my wife and i stayed here for one night and also used the spa services . i got a deep tissue massage which was awesome , my wife got a facial . the place was very clean and the staff was pleasant and accommodating . the hotel itself is very hip , it has a real club feel . the first floor bar and second floor lobby have a good layout , great decoration and in the evening they are comfortably crowded with a nice atmosphere . the rooms are unique but very comfortable . great view out the floor to ceiling window and you can tell that everything is new . quick note on the shower it shares a wall glass window with the room . the glass is covered with a curtain , but if you want to you can open the curtain from the room to have a full view of the shower in use . pretty fun . overall , this place is awesome and a great place for chicago . 
just stayed here again for vacation . another great stay . the room was a great size . love having a coffee maker , microwave refrigerator in the room , with trader joe ' s next door this can save you lots . the staff was always pleasant and very helpful . it is a great location just one block off the magnificent mile . will always stay here for pleasure or business when in town . just great location and value for the cost . 
i stayed at the fairmont in august N . it ' s a bit far away to write this review but i thought i would drop a line since i had a great experience . we booked through expedia . ca . i had written a comment to ask if we could get an upgrade since this is a special trip . i went with my aunt who had never travelled outside of toronto since she moved from hk N years ago and it was her first time taking the plane and visiting the us . the hotel gave us a big suite with N separate beds and we had a beautiful view . we stayed here for N nights and the service is fantastic . we forgot our slippers and called room service late at night and they came very quickly . the rooms are what you see on the website ' s pictures . and the hotel is very generous with the toiletries like shower cap , soap , shampoo , conditioner , shoe mit . if you need toothpaste , they will also bring it up . only downside is it ' s a bit of a walk to magnificent mile - a good N minutes . it ' s windy and very sunny so be sure to bring a scarf a light jacket at night . but it ' s close to the millenium park and the bean . there ' s a grocery store close to the hotel so we grabbed some snacks there . we also walked almost everywhere but took a cab to a nice restaurant further away . i highly recommend this hotel , the staff at the front desk are nice , accommodating and there ' s no attitude or snottiness . i booked early so i think you should do that if you want to secure a good price . we had a room on a high floor and never heard any noise from the the rooms next door . we didn ' t eat at the hotel restaurants and preferred venturing to cafes on magnificent mile and other streets in that area . 
stayed N nights in april . our room was very nice and newly renovated . six lifts so no long wait , you had to have a room key to use the lift after N . Npm . very large hotel so staff appeared not to be aware what was going on expect in there own area , front desk staff could not tell me opening hours for the bars or restaurants . as it is such a big hotel it has no atmosphere . booked this hotel on hotwire so got a bit of value would have been disappointed if i had paid full price . 
first time in chicago . . . stuck with one of our favourite hilton chains and we were not disappointed . very well priced . great location . walking distance to the theatre we were attending . close to three transit lines and a couple stops to shopping during the day and blues clubs at night . the rooms were well decorated , laid out and quite comfortable . what we have come to expect from a hampton . 
we just got home from a weekend at the palmer house-what a wonderful experience ! not only was it a beautiful hotel but everyone was so accomodating and friendly ! ! i will definetly stay there again ! ! 
stayed here for N nights . good location , near to the mag . mile . very large hotel with typical service ( both good and bad ) that you would expect . long wait for check-in - the three people on the desk kept disappearing for long periods behind a screen ! lady on the concierge was not very friendly ( as i see others have noted ) , and looked surprised that i wanted to know how to get to the art institute . worst thing was the sound insulation in the rooms . i had two connecting doors , and could hear everything from next door -conversations , toilet , television - well , i mean everything ! had to sleep with ear plugs in ! when will hotels learn that , if they have rooms with connecting doors , these should at least be insulated properly when not in use eg with padding or a sound-proof cover . i paid almost N per night , but it was like staying in a N star motel . no chance to move room as the hotel was completely full . apart from that it was ok - but the maid did keep knocking on the door , despite the fact that i had a do not disturb card on the door ! also , the soap in the shower gave me a rash ! i think there are better hotels in chicago for these prices . 
the raffaello is in a great location for spending a few days in chicago shopping and sightseeing . we self-parked our car at the garage across the street for N per day and left it there the entire time . great shopping and restaurants all within walking distance . the hotel itself is in a fairly quiet location . we had a double room which was pretty spacious for a downtown hotel . the beds were very comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean . the front desk staff was not very friendly , but the bell captains were always polite and helpful . we booked a N-night special through the hotel website for N per night which i would say was a great value for this convenient , updated hotel . 
the w lakeshore hotel is a great place to stay hands down ! ! i traveled solo on a business trip from new york and the treatment from when i walked into the " living room " to when i checked in was superb . the whatever whenever experience was executed to a t . whenever i requested a toothbrush , shaving kit and even floss , the young lady raquel brought it up to me with a smile . she was very kind and always used her name and never ceased to let me know if i needed anything else to let her know . i felt like i was bothering her at times but she didnt mind at all . . w lakeshore crew , you guys rock ! ! ! 
i have spend two separate weeks at this property recently , once during the month of january and once during february . this property is quite large though their staffing seems to have been greatly reduced . the concierge desk was never manned . i never saw more than two staffmembers at the front desk . the rooms are quite dated but are of a standard size and adequately maintained . the animal print wallpaper is peeling at spots and the furniture in the rooms is showing more than average wear and tear . the location of this property is just north of the chicago river and one block east of michigan avenue . the loop and the magnificent mile are within easy walking distance . the airport is easily accessed by cathing the N busline ( directly behind the pj clarke ' s restaurant in front of the hotel ) which will take you to milwaukee where you can catch the blue line to o ' hare . chicago ' s buses are equipped with visual and auditory indications for each stop . there are several excellent restaurants within walking distance of this hotel . transportation is excellent with a cta ( chicago transit authority ) N-day pass available for N . you can purchase this pass at the blue line station at o ' hare . beware if you are looking for dinner after a day of business meetings you will be hard set to find any restaurants open after Npm ! 
i stayed at this hotel when doing business at an office on the magnificent mile . the hotel was very functional . . . free wifi was a plus . . . and the adjoining starbucks was very convenient . i ordered room service one evening which took a very long time to arrive , but the next morning i had a note of apology under my door with a gift certificate for a free starbucks coffee . the room service food , though , was very good . i went out for a run one afternoon and found it easy to run down to millenium park and back in about N minutes . the last time i was doing business in this location , i stayed at the w hotel near the lake . it is obviously difficult to compare the two hotels , but i would stay at the courtyard again next time just for its basic good service , convenience , and functionality . 
a group of us stayed at the w lakeshore for a weekend for my sister ' s bachelorette party . we chose the package deal which was supposed to include a luxury suite for the bride and N friends , limo transportation to and from the clubs , and special vip treatement at le passage . instead , we got a suite with one king bed ( for N people ) , a bus , and the bouncers at le passage acted as though they had no idea what we were talking about . so obviously i ' d never recommend the bachelorette package . in addition , checking in took forever , the staff was unfriendly and rude , and the hotel decor is overrated . the only thing we liked about our stay were the bliss products in the bathroom ! 
this is the first time i stayed at the wyndham blake hotel . the common areas are uninspiring but the rooms are very large and nice . there are many drawers for storage in the rooms and in the bathrooms . my bathroom was also larger than an average hotel bathroom and and nicely decorated . the view out the window was a brick wall but i didn ' t get the room for the view . i wish i had tried the breakfast but i didn ' t . i had to get to work too early . the breakfast opens about N am . there is a restaurant that is attached and next door . it is pricey and not a place for a quick dinner on a business trip . it is more of a date-night-out restaurant . the door man , and the rest of the staff , were very helpful . overall , i liked the hotel and would recommend it to others if you need to be in the area . 
beautiful , modern rooms--a view provided based on request at check-in . fantastic concierge service--these people really love know the city--recommended things with knowlege and zeal plus there are N-N available at a time . no pool but rumor has it , you can swim somewhere nearby . gracious and accomodating staff , perfect location--be forewarned ( and the woman checking us in did tell us ) that their mini-bar is on a sensor system and if you move anything--you will be charged . 
we stayed at the seneca easter weekend N . we had a great time and really enjoyed the hotel . the people who worked there were friendly and very helpful with restaurants and bus schedules . we would stay there again and not think twice about it . our room was nice and big and clean . the tv worked just fine . didn ' t use the kitchen but there seemed to be plenty of dishes , pans and silverware . maybe the people who had a problem with the staff had an attitude of there own . we found the staff to be very friendly and helpful . we ate in the restaurant upstairs and had a super meal . the hotel is right off of michigan ave , where you can walk everywhere you want to go . 
came from las vegas to chicago for a family wedding . the hotel was beautiful , staff was great very helpful . beds were the best i have ever had in a hotel room . hotel was in great location walking distance to everything . staff was top notch very helpful . 
great hotel - great room size . concierge was very helpful . overall wonderful experience ! 
if it weren ' t for the location there would be nothing about this hotel that was positive . the room was slightly larger than a walk in closet and stunk like a moldy basement . the bathroom door had a broken hinge and couldn ' t close . the toilet didn ' t want to flush . the tv reception was terrible . there were cigarette butts all over the window ledge in this non smoking room . the shower was a joke . . no pressure and tepid water temp . the shower curtain was too short so water got everywhere . the floors looked dirty and the paint on the woodwork was all chipped . the hallway smelled worse than the room and needed repairs to the walls and baseboards . there were picketers outside who kept blowing loud shrill whistles as they picketed . it took the valet over N N hour to get our car for us from the parking lot just around the corner . if we could have found another hotel we would have ran as fast as we could from this one . all in all , the worse hotel experience we ever had . and all this at a N-N star price , what a rip off . 
my business partner and i travel to chicago every year for a convention . last year we stayed at the ritz carlton and it was very nice , if not a bit stodgy . we had walked by the sofitel and i thought i ' d give it a try . the hotel is very modern and beautiful . even though i ' m N years old now , i can at least pretend that i am young and hip . we booked N junior suites for about the same as we would ' ve paid at the ritz . my partner got a awesome corner room . i ended up in a ' disabled ' junior suite . while i would ' ve preferred my partner ' s room , my room was still very nice . being that it was for disabled guests it had N seperate showers and a seperate tub in the bathroom . it also had these really cool automatic curtains that my partner ' s room didn ' t have . anyway , stil a really cool room . there are two bars downstairs both pouring great french champagne by the glass . we ordered room service a couple of times and it was excellent . i highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again . 
i left the raffaello in late november after a very pleasant ( as always ) two-night stay . but i forgot my bag , including laptop etc . , in the garage across the street when i was packing the car to depart . didn ' t notice until i was back home . i called the hotel . staff were very helpful . a valet ran across the street and retrieved my bag . i talked to the sunday manager who arranged to have my bag shipped to me the next day . i ' ve always liked the raffaello . now i ' m a bigger fan than ever . 
the rooms in this hotel are very large and luxurious . the entryway allows one to enter without people in the hallway seeing much of the room , so there is more privacy than most hotel rooms . the closet opens from two sides - one from the bedroom and one from the bathroom . the shower and tub are located behind a glass door in the bathroom , there is a double vanity sink , and the toilet is in its own separate room . toothpaste and a toothbrush , as well as the typical amenities , are provided for free . my only negative comment about the room is that the two beds were small . there is a lap pool with several lanes and boards and fins . this is a great hotel for those looking for luxury and are willing to pay for it . 
we enjoyed our stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago . upon arrival we were treated with great hospitality . the desk staff was friendly and took the time to visit with us about our room and its pros and what she thought might be a con - the size . our room was small , but was beautiful and very comfortable . we had a great view of the lake . the furnishing seemed expensive and unique . they decor was fabulous and the bed was delightfully comfortable with great linens . the room was very clean upon arrival and was always cleaned with perfection each day we returned from our adventures throughout the city . the hotel as a whole seemed like we stepped back in time . i loved the boutique feel from the mirrored elevators , rotary style phone in the hallway to the old mail slots . we would definitely stay here again ! we loved chicago and this hotel . 
my husband and i stayed at the amalfi for N nights in july . front desk staff are amazing , very helpful . we loved the fact that breakfast is served on each floor very convenient . however , the " happy hour " or " manager ' s reception " each evening was the highlight of our stay at the amalfi . great drinks , tasty appetizers and a great way to mingle with other guests . i would stay here again and have recommended it to a number of our friends . 
our party of three stayed four nights at the comfort suites over a long weekend . the hotel couldn ' t be better located for a leisure trip to chicago just a short walk to the museums , the loop , and to shopping dining on the michigan avenue . the lobby is small if you ' re used to the fancier hotels downtown , but the rooms are larger in comparison to those we ' ve had in other downtown hotels on earlier chicago visits . we had booked a N queen suite , but were upgraded on arrival to a huge N bedroom , N bath suite ( if you ' re reading this comfort suites , thanks again ) . the room was clean but the furnishings were dated and due for upgrades and new carpet . we noted a leak at the toilet which was quickly repaired on the day we notified the front desk . the front desk was very attentive and responded quickly to any request we made . the room had a full kitchen , which we used for dinner comfortably one evening after a trip to trader joe ' s a few blocks away . our biggest pet peeves were noise and wifi access . you expect outside noise in a city like chicago , but most of the noise was internal from the a c system or from the appliances in the kitchen area . we did find that it became white noise quickly and it didn ' t keep me from comfortable sleep . however , if you ' re a light sleeper it could be an issue , especially in the front bedroom which is separated from the kitchen by an open doorway with no door . wifi is provided but for most of our stay the connection ranged from barely usable to not worth trying . breakfast was the average budget hotel quality and the hot options were lower quality than what we ' re used to . it ' s ok if you want cereal , but we found ourselves across michigan avenue at cafe decartes for excellent coffee and pastries . despite our peeves , i considered the comfort suites a great value considering that it was by far the lowest cost option for downtown chicago for a room that could house three adults comfortably . we weren ' t expecting the ritz , and the location was great and the staff as attentive and helpful as we ' ve had at much fancier hotels . 
we enjoyed this hotel this winter . the location is magnificent , N blocks from the michigan ave . , less than N meters to the red line mta train that takes you virtually everywhere . nice view ( floor N ) . the pool is very good and also the business center ( complimentary use of pc and printer ) . within the hotel there is free wifi . 
i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel ! yes , the mini-bar and rendez-vous terrace drinks are way expensive , but given the high-end nature of this hotel , not overpriced . beautiful room , bathroom , tv , comfy bed , central location , etc . i could go on ! i would definately stay here again . staff were friendly and heplful as well . 
the location is very convenient . if you are coming from the airport the blue line stops right outside of the hotel . the rooms are very clean and are kept that way each day by the housekeeping staff . the hotel is close to all chicago ' s important sites and has some great restaurants in the area . the staff is friendly and helpful . my only complaint is that breakfast is served in the small lobby so if there are a lot of guests there at the same time it can get a bit hectic . there are N computers and a printer in the lobby which was very convenient . very reasonable prices for the location and rooms . i ' ll definitely be staying there on my next trip to chicago ! 
we stayed at the ohio house last weekend on a three day stay in chicago . being a fairly expensive city , budget accomodation was something we needed and the ohio house provided . the ohio house is located close to the heart of the city ( a few blocks back from michigan avenue ) . the rooms are small to average size bathrooms average hotel size , with very N ' s style appearence and decor . most people tend to assume that budget accomodation in an expensive city means hygiene problems , however the ohio house , we found to be , was extremely clean ( N stars in that department ) . the motel also has its own small coffee house where we had breakfast on one of our days there . its was nice , but again very N ' s style which was interesting . chicago is full of delicious resturants and cafes though - my personal recommendation is a little french style cafe ' cosi ' , a block or so back from michigan avenue ) . the ohio house is also directly across the road from a large mcdonald ' s ( not that you ' d go all the way to chicago just to eat mcdonald ' s ! ) there was only one issue we had with the ohio house and that was the noise from the streets at night . but the ohio house is a very clean , comfortable stay for anyone wishing to take a budget holiday in chicago - which was a beautiful city . personally , i would stay there again if i was looking for budget accomodation - but should there be available funds , i would probably choose to stay in one of the larger hotels in the city . 
what i loved stayed in the historic building ( the hotel is two buildings conjoined - one old , one new ) and our room was large and lovely . bathroom had both a tub and a shower . beds were lovely with that " sheet on the outside of the blanket and inside of the blanket " thing going on , which is so nice . pillows very comfortable . we loved loved loved the " eno " wine bar downstairs - they do cheese , chocolate and wine only - how neat is that ? we tasted a different flight each night we were there . hotel is close to almost everything - just a couple blocks away from the river to catch the architecture tour on the millenium mile for great shopping , easy walking distance from the red line , easy walking distance from fantastic restaurants ( we went to frontera grill and cafe grand lux ) . annoyances couldn ' t properly open the curtains to let light in the hotel room . gym and computer usage were extra and pricey ( altho i sprang for the gym and it was very well stocked with equipment ) . pool area was beautiful - tho not quite as lovely as swisshotel - where the pool has the best view in the city . overall , would give swisshotel the nod for their more beautiful view of the lake , but this hotel was still quite ideal . 
the hotel burnham is a great spot in chicago ' s theatre district and near many downtown tourist attractions ( e . g . sears tower , chicago theatre , etc . ) . some of the more unique features of the hotel include an old style elevator with gate and the use of keys to open your room . . . yes , real keys ( not cards ) ! the rooms are small , but very tastefully done , with a beautiful poster bed and canopy . the windows are decorated with velvet like curtains with musical scores by mozart in gold colored script , to emphasize the hotel ' s proximity to various performing arts venues . each evening , the hotel hosts a wine reception in the lobby , which is a nice respite after a long workday . the breakfast menu is also quite enjoyable , especially the delicious eggs benedict and fresh squeezed orange juice . i only spent two nights here , but would be happy to come back ! 
my family and i scored a great rate of N a night for the sheraton for a quick weekend trip to chicago . the hotel is in a good location and even though it was february , we were still able to walk to michigan ave . fairly easily from the hotel . check-in was quick and easy . the lobby is beautiful and definitely makes the hotel look like a N-star but that ' s about where the stars start to fade . the elevators are clean and quick . our rooms were on the Nth floor . there were newspapers and food trays strewn about the hallway as we arrived and they were not removed until the following day . the rooms were reasonably clean with the exception of a piece of candy on our floor , a large iron burn mark on the middle of the bedspread and some mold on the shower head . these are things that are easy to overlook in a N or N star hotel but i think it is unacceptable in a N-star hotel . the rooms are good size and the beds are comfortable with decent linens . the toiletries are higher end and made the shower more enjoyable . the mini-bar is an absolute joke as the prices are ridiculous . a bottle of water was N . N ! my parents ate in the breakfast restaurant and said the food was fresh and pretty good . we were only at the hotel for a few nights but it suited our needs . i don ' t think i would stay at this hotel if i had to pay full price for a room but i would definitely stay here again for N or less . 
we came from gatineau and stayed for N days at the indigo in beginning of october . it was very nice . thanks to tom and the lovely staff over there . we had a wonderful time ! 
i was surprised and very disappointed with the bad service here . westin hotels are usually pretty good but this was not the case here . i only stayed N night and had quite a few problems . some were small ( but irritating ) and good hotels always pay attention to the small details . that was not the case here . for example ( N ) room service lunch - they included bread rolls but not enough butter ( N ) room service dinner - it took N mins to arrive and they sent the wrong order . since it was after N . Npm the kitchen was then closed . i was put on hold for N minutes and then told i could order from a local italian take-out ( they would pay ) . an ok response i guess but by then it was near midnight and i would have to wait again for the food . ( N ) the room only had N dim lights and was very dark . i called " service express " to get an additional light sent to the room . i had to call them N times before anyone delivered a light ( despite being told during the first N calls that it was coming ) . this took at least N hours . i will not stay here again . i have stayed at the sofitel before and should have gone back there - it was awesome . 
a friend and i stayed here for N nights . as it was our first time in chicago , we wanted something with easy access to shopping , lots of things to do and places to eat . the allerton did not disappoint . we were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to do ( parks , navy pier , shopping , restaurants , etc ) . we did have to take a bus to bucktown , but the stop was right near the hotel . the staff were friendly , though we didn ' t interact with them too much . the room was in good condition and clean , but the layout was awkward , not allowing the person on the far side of the bed much room to walk to their side ( less than a foot ) . as two girls , we didn ' t mind sharing one bed , but it was hard to get around without disturbing one an other . we were very impressed with the fitness center . there are several cardio machines ( bikes , elliptical , N treadmills ) each with their own tv screen and weight machines free weights . it was clean and there were always plenty of towels . it is bright and airy and wasn ' t overly crowded when we were there . the restaurant in the hotel was ok . it had good food , but not really a good place to have a ' night out . ' overall , we would happily stay at the allerton again it was the best value for us . 
i am no great fan of big city hotels . i prefer a nice comfort inn with free parking and breakfast . but each year i go to chicago during midwest music clinic with my kids to baby sit and help out . this year we stayed at the sheraton and i really enjoyed it . the staff was friendly and the room was beautiful , with a nice view . i made friends with the housekeeper on our floor the first day and never lacked for plenty of whatever i needed . the pool is free , although i had been confused when i read that the fitness center charged . corporate messed up my sons reservations just about every way they could , including charging for days not reserved . it was a mess , but when we arrived everything was fine . i did not eat in the hotel or use room service . on the nights i stayed in to babysit , i grabbed food from dominicks and fox and obels . this hotel is close to lots of things . a great location . 
the downtown chicago fairfield inn is a hidden gem in chicago ' s downtown . located on a tree lined street one block from the magnificent mile and N minute walk to the lake , we felt we were in a quiet hidden neighborhood in the city . the hotel is very clean , nicely decorated with a modern decor and the staff is exceptionally helpful . the suite with the living room ( pullout sofa ) , minifridge and microwave make longer stays very comfortable and would work well for families with children . 
i stayed for just one nite at the sheraton hotel and towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other ta posters but i was not let down . i got the room via pl N and was first placed in a room on the Nth floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot . since i had nothing to lose , i asked to be moved to a " room with a view " . the front desk attendant ( rasheeda ) wanted to make sure that the room i had at first was clean and was in order and i assured her that it was . she then moved me up to the Nth floor with ease and it took about N minute . i was quite surprised as i have heard that they treat pl and hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers . the new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the navy pier , a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of lake michigan . all this for N ? yep ! i skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious ! the room was comfy , had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location . i didnt use it since i wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk . the bed and pillows were very comfy , but i awoke at about N in the morning sweating from the comfy but very warm and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed . this was a great deal for the price and i would absolutely stay here again . 
my stay at the hard rock hotel was a delight . i usually try to avoid business travel because i don t get a good night sleep . this experience with you was superb ! my good night sleep helped me to enjoy the whole experience of being in chicago and attending our conference . the hotel was very interesting , exciting and so pleasant . what wonderful workers you have there . there is a real comfortable ambience about the whole hotel . thank you , thank you for a memorable experience . i intend to return not just for business but also for pleasure ! sincerely , connie chestnut cmsw alzheimer s association of southeastern wisconsin
my husband and i stayed at the hyatt recently and had a great experience . staff was friendly and helpful , rooms were updated , roomy , and very clean . the location downtown to resturants , shopping and attractions was great . to address some of the cons listed by other reviews . . the hotel is large and , as would be expected , the lobby is full of activity , including the great lobby bar that looks out over the city . yes , there is a disco club atmosphere at night but if you looked at the hotel ' s website before you booked you know exactly what you are getting . the dance club didn ' t get started until later evening when kids shouldn ' t be out anyway . we were informed in advance that if you enter the minibar a sensor is set off so there would be a charge . the parking at N a day is very average as anyone who stays in a big city would know and it was quite easy for us to get our car when we needed it without any long waits . there were also complaints listed about the hot water and towels--the water was always hot even when showering during the busy morning hours and the towels were more than adequate . we have traveled all over the world and this hyatt is a great choice for fun weekend in chicago . 
the location is great if you plan on doing a lot of running around chicago . it ' s walking distance to both lake el stations which means you have every el line close by and a straight ride from o ' hare for N . N . the lobby is large and a nice place to meet and hang out . they have N pay computers to use . i have some status and got probably the best room location , a river view at the end of the hall . the room looked like housekeeping had cleaned it in a hurry , the drawers were all open and a couple of spots needed a sweeping though . the room was a bit larger than normal and the bathroom was large . between the wide bathtub and curved shower curtain rod i felt like i was showering in a wet room . sheets and towels were of good quality as was everything else . everything else was westin nominal . definately recommend ! 
stayed here for a few days for work . the location is great on ohio between michigan and st clair , right off mag mile . there is no room service , and the elevators are inconsistent as they lights and indicators don ' t always work . the bathrooms are a little older and the window ac units are a little loud . however the rooms are clean and the service was very nice and friendly . 
this hotel was recommended by friends and it was absolutely spot on the location is great , one block at away from the magnificent mile , just off the john hancock tower and within walking distance of all major shopping . the room was large and clean , with a small kitchenette and a very clean , but relatively small bathroom . just the thing you need for a ( long ) weekend in chicago ! 
i spent a week in the chicago area and had two separate stays at the palmer house . ( spent a night in oak park for a wedding ) the first stay was disappointing but the second made up for it . the first time my boyfriend and i arrived at the hotel we were not offered any help with our luggage . i had three heavy bags and was clearly struggling . the staff was standing around in front of the door but no one could actually open it . it was very windy and the doors were heavy and the effort to open the door made me drop my suitcases . for the age of the hotel the room size was generous . the only problem was that the room was dirty . the dresser was sticky and one of the decorative pillows had a stain on it . the concierge was rude but the dinner recommendation she gave was good . the second time i arrived at the hotel valet immediately greeted us , the bellmen helped with the baggage and there was someone to open the door . my party arrived at Nam , but were able to check in early . ( the rooms weren ' t on the same floor but we opted not to wait for closer rooms . ) my boyfriend and i received an e-standby upgrade so for an additional N a night we got a huge room . there was a dining room , wet bar , large living room , two flat screen tvs , and one and a half baths . we had dinner in lockwood one night and it was pretty good . they had run out of the sparkling wine i wanted but there were plenty of other options . overall my biggest disappointment was the gift shop ( which i think was operated by an independent group . . . ) the hotel has such a rich history and a beautiful logo but there weren ' t any souvenir options that reflected this . the only hotel specific items were one out dated postcard and a tee shirt . the picture on the post card did not show the current furnishings and decor of the lobby and the shirt was very plain and over priced . i would have liked a hotel magnet or something with the peacock logo . 
i stayed at the burnham for a recent business trip to chicago . from the time i checked in , till the time i checked out the staff could not have been more accomodating . the hotel is located right across the street from macy ' s on state street and N N N blks from the el . i took the train from midway and it was a short walk to the hotel . the room was small , but well appointed . appreciated the in-room controls for air and heat . room service was able to accomodate my request for something " not on the menu " . definitely made my trip very enjoyable . 
had to go to chicago and stayed at the drake . the hotel itself was really beautiful and what you would imagine a grand hotel would be like . our room faced the water which was very nice . good size and clean . obviously the location cannot be beat-you ' re close to everything ! concierge friendly and made us dinner reservations . it ' s not super deluxe but there is a distinct charm that cannot be replicated in some of the newer , more modern or fancier hotels in chicago . loved that chanel was located in the hotel ! 
we loved this hotel and would definitely come back . initially we weren ' t given a goldfish , which was disappointing , but then we left a tip for the housekeeper , and she rewarded us with one . we had fun sipping wine and playing wii in the lobby every afternoon . the staff were quite friendly and helpful , even printing our boarding passes for us . our room was very comfortable , with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper . at first we were worried about noise , since our room was next to the elevator , but we hardly heard it , and didn ' t notice any street noise either . the hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated , well-lit , and ideally located . 
i was able to stay at the w hotel lakeshore with a family member that had a comp stay for a business trip . the hotel is located in front of lake michigan off chicago ' s famous scenic lake shore drive . the hotel room was very modern and hip and beds were comfortable . . the bathroom looked really cool . . . but wasn ' t very practical . it was dark so it was tough to see clearly in the mirrors . there wasn ' t much sink space , the shower was a bit tricky and there were slotted doors and windows connecting the bathroom to the bed area so you could hear everything . the view on the other hand was spectacular . it looked right onto lake michigan and navy pier . the hallways leading to the rooms reminded us off decor taken from tlc ' s trading spaces with smooth pebble stones bordering the walls floor . we didn ' t take advantage of the fitness or pool area nor the restaurants , but there is a great ( but expensive bar ) on the roof ( whiskey room ) ) with one of the best views of chicago at night . and there is a trendy bar on the first floor off the lobby that caters to the hip after work crowd . the location is a bit out of the way but walking distance to michigan avenue shopping restaurants and the john hancock building . the doorman can easily get taxi ' s there as well . it is also pretty close cab ride to navy pier and to the amc river east N movie theater . so overall , if you are looking for a trend setting hip place thats a little pricey but has a great view this would be a place to go . 
i have stayed here N times in the past N days and i have been thoroughly impressed with the property and staff . everyone is friendly , professional , and helpful . yes , things can and do wrong from time to time - it would be foolish to think otherwise . however , it is how the staff handle the situation or problem is what counts , and this staff always step up to the plate , apologize ( even if it is not their fault ) and immediately begin to resolve it . the hotel is in a great location , about a block from michigan ave ( major shopping ) and very easy walks to subway metro , as well as state street , rush st , and other sights . the rooms are immaculate , clean , and well maintained . i never had a problem at all in their area and have always been happy sleeping on these amazing beds ! the wifi is reasonably priced , but there are plenty of free hot spots within walking distance . i am a little sad that they do not have a pool - probably , my single downside with this hyatt . prices fluctuate a lot so check often . i have scored rooms between N- N . the area is safe , walkable , and family friendly ! 
the fairmont hotel in chicago has the best value for a weekend in chicago . it is a great location . just south of the mag mile , and just north of millenium park . i took my wife for her birthday and we arrive mid-friday afternoon . we were very courteously greeted by the doorman , escorted by the bell hop to the front desk . he waited while we checked in and then delivered our bags to our room while we retreated directly to the bar for a relaxing " happy hour " . they had some very nice light snacks on the menu there . the hotel is not the most up to date , but the room was very nice and clean , with a very comfortable bed . we walked north for dinner in the evening . in the morning they had an excellent selection of pastries and fruit in the atrium for reasonable prices , plus fresh oj and coffee . i liked that much better than the room service option because you could pick out exactly what you wanted . after a late checkout we took a nice walk through millenium park and the art intitute before heading home . this was our Nnd stay the the chicago fairmont and we it will continue to be our choice for downtown chicago . we have also stayed at other fairmonts and found them to be excellent as well . 
the w hotel greets you with glitter , glamour , and warmth . there is plentiful help right at the door . inside , the lobby is a work of art married with hospitality . concierge service always available right there . the room we stayed in had a wonderful view , great decore , and was very comfortable . the bathroom was something i had never seen before . the fixtures were the latest design , and there was plenty of mirror and counter space . the walls of the bathroom were woven wood , and there was an opening with shutters so you could see out and watch tv while shaving , perhaps . soundproof it was not , making it easy to carry on a conversation with the door slid shut , but not so easy to cover noises you might not want to carry out into the room . there is a super gift boutique just off the lobby with elegant cosmetics and fashions . staying at the w was a memorable experience . the memory still makes me smile . 
what a great find ! inexpensive ( compared to most downtown chicago hotels ) , convenient location , and a great room . i have read other reviews that complained about the size of the rooms my room was perfectly big enough for me and would have been fine for two . the bed was great , comfortable , the room very elegant and servicable . small but very well-appointed bathroom with a huge shower . plenty of storage throughout room . room and entire hotel was clean , clean , clean . great eatery attached ( english pub ) with great wait-staff , or you can order in and have food delivered . valet parking reasonable and convenient ( and pleasant attendants ) . the hotel was full of students that night , but my room was N quiet . as a very frequent traveler i highly recommend this hotel . happy travels ! 
i stayed here while attending a conference at the marriott across the street . this was cheaper and more comfortable . as other reviewers have noted , this is a gem of a hotel . it ' s a true suite , with living room , full kitchen , and bedroom . the living room has a sofabed , sitting chair , coffee table and N " lcd tv . there is a small dining table desk next to the kitchen . the kitchen has microwave , two burner oven , dishwasher , coffee maker , fridge . also plates , pots pans and silverware . the room was clean and comfortable with no obvious signs of wear . the king size bed was also comfy , though not as high end as you would find in a nicer hotel . there is a regular tube tv in the bedroom . the free buffet breakfast had scrambled eggs , meats , cereal , make your own waffles , etc . there is also a dinner with a different menu mon-thurs but i did not have that . there is a gym inhouse , but you can use the crunch gym next door ( same building ) that is much bigger and has everything . the entrance is not much to look at just an elevator to the sixth floor where reception is . but the bellman was friendly and the reception desk was efficient and very friendly . it does cost a lot to park here ( i think N night so don ' t bring a car ) . there is a small store next to reception , open N N . free wired and wireless internet in the room . only minor complaint is that the walls are somewhat thin so if the neighbor raises his voice i can hear it . also , i can hear water running next door . but all in all i would definitely stay here again . it ' s much more comfortable and better value than the big hotels nearby . 
my college best friend and i choose to visit chicago for a weekend and wanted to find a hotel with a good price and a decent location . the hilton chicago fit the bill and had a hilton double points offer , which was very appealing . it was also just a short cab ride from the train station . the check-in process took quite awhile as we had to wait in a rather long line . however , we were given a complimentary upgrade to one of their double-beded two bathroom rooms with a lakeview ( we had only booked a double-bedded room so i believe we got a bit of a deal ) . we were happy to have a lake view and it was immensely helpful to have two bathrooms ! however , there was only one hairdryer but we deduced that was so we don ' t blow a fuse , and we took turns . though it is not on the busy magnificant mile area ( it ' s a little farther south ) , it is still in a good location and a short walk to the field museum . the lobby and common areas are really impressive , with historic decor . 
i travel at least N times a yr for work and twice a year with family , so i put in a lot of time at hotels . my room was freezing cold and the thermometer in the room didn ' t make a difference . i was told by engineering that the hotel had turned on ac and it would take a couple of hours for the heat to come back on . i ended up taking a long hot shower and getting in bed and using the blow dryer to warm me up . they promised to send up hot tea , but after N minutes and no delivery i had to call to ask . about N minutes later a pot of tea showed up , but it was highly caffeinated breakfast tea at N N at night ! ! ! the same night , someone attempted to enter my room . luckily i had both locks on . i think it was housekeeping . i don ' t know how they couldn ' t hear the tv which was turned up loud so that i could hear it over the blowdryer ! ! ! the second day , i called guest services to tell them that my tv wasn ' t working . after hitting N and waiting about N rings , i hung up . i tried again and had the same experience . i thought , what if it was a medical emergency and no one answered ! ! ! ! the handle on my toilet had to be held in order for it to be flushed . it reminded me of my old house ! i called down for toothpaste N minutes ago . i ' m still waiting . given all of the choices in a downtown area like this and with the tough economy , there have to be other hotels that provide better service . 
the keys to my cadillac cts was given to someone off the street by the valet company . valet authority inc . which the hotel requires you to use . i am out of pocket for the insurance deductible and the rekeying of my home . this happened on my wedding night no less . they have been no help and evidently don ' t care to help resolve my remaining issues . the general manager called me once and left a message never bothering to return my calls and talk to me personally . 
my review of the hampton inn will be a little dated , but it definitely deserves high praise . my girlfried and i stayed here in august N for N nights . this was both our first time visiting chicago . we couldn ' t have been happier with our selection . we picked this place based on the reviews on tripadvisor . com . thanks to all for their honest reviews ! if you ' re looking for a place with a great location , this is it ! it was very easy to navigate throughout the city from this loaction . getting to the hotel from the airport was easy as well . one train stop will get you block or two away from the front door ! don ' t expect a grand entrance , because there is none . what you get in terms of value is the location , service , and room quality . we also enjoyed the continental breakfast every morning and the free wireless internet inside our room . if you don ' t have time to sit for breakfast , they offer free travel snack bags . chicago in the middle of summer was quite hot , but our air conditioner was excellent . the bed was amazingly comfortable . we were well rested day in and day out . as for location , you can ' t beat it . it is so close to public transportation and is walkable to many major tourists sites . it is also very close to many great restaurants and shopping . next time we go to chicago , we will be staying here ! great job majestic inn ! 
for a large chain hotel with a lot of conferences going on while we were there my sister and i felt the staff was extremely friendly and helpful . when i arrived at my room i requested an extra luggage stand , it arrived within minutes plus extra pillows . the door man was very helpful and explained the workings of the hotel . the outrageous charge for wifi is so over the top , it is free at small chain hotels ! it is free in the starbucks down in the lobby . the room was large , the beds very comfortable , the bath was well supplied , and the linens comfortable . the location is great , close to shopping and good restaurants . 
the hotel is getting a little dated . the stetson restaurants still has great steaks and impressive service . my husband was on business and i tagged along . he left for a business trip early in the morning with all bags so i could go home on the train without luggage . unfortunately he took all my clothes . he left early morning and i slept in and found out i only had a silk shell for clothing . called the hotel shop and they only carry t shirts so i called the front desk . vickie came to my rescue with an employee uniform so i could get to a store and purchase clothes . even though i usually don ' t stay here i will definetly be staying here every time i am in chicago . vickie thank you again . 
do not book this hotel using an online site like hotels . com ! ! we booked a king bed non smoking for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary . upon arriving a very rude front deck clerk informed us that they " crowne plaza metro " did not have to honor our king bed booking because it was made with an online service and instead we were going to get a double room . if we didnt take it we would lose all the money . final in the room we find two small beds . im a big guy . so , to make a long story short . i spent my anniversary sleeping alone . my wife woke the next day with a rash from the detergent they use . ( we hope thats what it was ) so thank you crowne plaza metro for an anniversary that nether my wife or i will ever forget ! 
i travel often for business and stay at N-N star hotels as well as the usual marriott courtyard or hilton hotels . this hotel was great . i reserved the king executive which had windows facing michigan avenue as well as on the adjacent wall . we could not believe how quiet the room was-- no noise from michigan avenue or other guests , etc . amazingly and wonderfully quiet hotel room . the room was well appointed , huge , and immaculate . ( any hotel that puts stark white comforters on the beds has confidence in its cleanliness and i always take that as a good sign . ) the big surprise at this hotel was the dining . i almost never dine at the restaurants in a hotel at which i am staying . ( usually too many great other options in a city ) we had a case of the munchies upon checking in so we ordered appetizers via room service . service was quick , sharp , and the food was very good . the next day , we had lunch at the Nth floor rooftop garden restaurant ( outdoors ) which has a fabulous view and again , was amazingly quiet given the location of this hotel . the food was fantastic . we only ordered maine lobster roll sandwiches so we were ' t expecting an amazing culinary experience . . . . surprise ! the presentation was lovely and the lobster roll came on a platter with several " samplers " --- soup , cabbage slaw , homemade chips , and a sinful chocolate mouse cake . i ' ve had lobster rolls in dozens of places up and down the eastern seaboard and i ' ll tell you that this was the best , most flavorful , and freshest i ' ve had . the whole dining experience greatly exceeded my expectations . i would say that this hotel is a gem in the city and recommend it without reservation of any kind . enjoy ! 
N adults and N elementary-aged kids stayed for a N day , N night spring break . we loved the fact that our two rooms faced each other across a private alcove off the main hall . the rooms were very clean , beds comfortable and pillows large and fluffy . the tv was a new flat screen and there was an in-room safe . would have been nice to have a small fridge but we did okay without . the front desk staff was exceptionally friendly each day especially wallace , the concierge . the pool is rather hard to get too from the east end of the hotel and was chilly . no hottub . all in all , i would give this hotel N stars out of N . 
my husband and i just returned from the omni . we were there for just a N night stay . . . december N-N . since it was a holiday weekend , the hotel , and the rest of the city was jammed . our experience there was wonderful . we had a prompt and friendly check in . our room was very comfortable and clean . beautiful granite counters in the bathroom , pillow-top beds , and the living area were especially nice to relax in . i would encourage anyone who is considering a stay at the omni to join the select guest program they offer . it ' s free , and little amenities like juice and coffee delivered to your room free in the morning are really nice . we called on the concierge , both amiri and kevin , several times and each time they were able to help us and direct us to great restuarants , activities , etc . both were very helpful and amiri was kind enough to see that we got a wonderful bottle of wine or champagne on our anniversary . if when we return to chicago , i would most likely stay at the omni again , especially if we could get the same great rate . 
i went to chicago for a wedding and the wedding guests stayed at elysian . seriously this is the most amazing , outstanding hotel . my room was so luxurious i actually wished i had more time to spend in it ! i had a great living room area . the bathroom was gorgeous too with a great tub shower the tv in the mirror . 
my husband and i had stayed at the swissotel several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed our visit . we flew into chicago and rented a car to tour wisconsin before attending a board meeting there . we decided to spend the last night of our trip , on our return to chicago , at the swissotel for memories sake . we were able to get an outstanding lake view room for sunday night . though the hotel was completely booked , due to two conventions on friday and saturday nights , when we decided to stay an extra night on saturday , we were wait listed for that night . even though there was a mix-up with our original sunday night booking and it and our wait-list had been lost , upon calling back , the person i spoke with was able to confirm a wonderful lake view room on the Nst floor for both nights . once again we had a most delightful stay and thoroughly enjoyed the terrific view of lake michigan . our room was beautiful , extremely comfortable , and incredibly clean . perhaps my only complaint is the N per day parking fee , but that seems to be the norm for large cities . our two meals in their palm restaurant was another story . see separate review . 
went for a long weekend , a " last hurrah " trip before son N leaves for college . we are getting very spoiled and are leaning towards four seasons whenever it is a choice ( and when we can get a deal that is only outrageous , not astronomical ! ) although the hotel seemed almost N N empty . . . there were really no deals to be had other than the buy two nights , one night free . this would have been too expensive for us with two rooms , ( which is what we really wanted ) so we crammed into a deluxe executive suite , approx N night with taxes . . . ( and don ' t forget the N plus per night parking ! ) whew ! lucky that third night was " free " . but we knew all this going in so it is not a strike against the hotel . but what is does is set expectations extremely high . . . the lobby is beautiful , large , sunny , nice fountain in the middle . our room , on the Nth floor . . . . eh . . . . it had a main sitting room with a pull out couch , then the master bedroom separated by frosted french doors . it did have two bathrooms , but they were small and not " luxurious " at all , with combined bath shower . also , we joked about the " ergodynamic " toilets . . . they are kind of low , and rather tilt you backwards . there was enough room for the four of us , but tight when the rollaway was out . the main king size bed was extremely comfortable , nice fluffy bath towels and i love those four seasons robes . it was clean . oddly there was no tv channel information , that would have been appreciated . of course teen sons quickly figured out the remote to get channel listings , but my old eyes couldn ' t see it very well on the t . v . when laying on the bed . you can request newspapers to be delivered to your door every morning , which we did . we went down to look at the spa pool area first thing . it was unimpressive , to say the least . the pool is a small , very small lap pool . the whirlpool was small and didn ' t look very appealing at all , like not so clean , and not filled all the way ? as far as i could tell , it was not being cleaned at the time as there was no sign and a family was in it ! i did work out in their gym , and the equipment , for a hotel gym , was very good . nice touch to have cooled towels available and someone going around bringing everyone water . we did not eat at the hotel , nor did very many others by the look of the lobby restaurant every time we passed by . we did have coffee and drinks at the lobby bar , that was nice ( and , yes , expensive ! ) so yes , i liked this hotel , didn ' t love it , probably will try somewhere else in the future as for me , it did not justify the cost and have that " four seasons " feeling . it ' s not fair to compare a city four seasons to a resort four seasons ( like nevis , one of the most magical stays in the world ) but i have stayed at the st . louis four seasons , which was , to me , way more impressive than this one , and will be staying at the four seasons philadelphia in a few weeks , which my husband has already stayed in , and loves . i will then have a direct , big city four seasons comparison . 
got an excellent deal on hotels . com a few months back . rooms were stately and huge ( living room area with chairs and couch and separate dining room table ) . kitchenette with amenities . big bedroom with full bath and a half-bath between living room and bedroom . complimentary breakfast was tasty and filling . only N per night for a roll-away . elevators are quite slow , the only drawback . located near the lake and close to the magnificent mile . 
although i have lived in chicago for years and occasionally spend a weekend downtown , i was unaware of this little gem . the hotel is well-located to attractions , shopping , and restaurants . the decor is elegant and modern . the lounge area with the compimentary wine hour in the evenings and the coffe tea service in the mornings is a nice touch . we had booked a one-bedroom luxury suite and a double queen room for six women celebration a special birthday . one woman in our group is a frequent guest at this hotel so she was able to procure a very good rate . she also asked that special note be made of the birthday celebration and asked for wine and a small cake to be delivered to the room - not necessarily complimentary but to have these items available . by the day of check-in she had not heard back from the concierge and expressed her disappointment at the front desk . they quickly made amends by first , delivering wine , nuts , fruit , and chocolate-covered espresso beans . then at N , two excellent cheese plates were delivered . when we returned to the room after dinner , a small strawberry shortcake cake was waiting for us . we we also given an extra cot at no extra charge for the suite . the service , decor , and charm of this hotel will have me back for a repeat visit . 
i had my doubts about this hotel when i first blind booked through a third party site . the price was just a little too good and the location too perfect for it to be real . we breathed a sigh of relief when we walked into our room . upon arrival they " upgraded " us to a top floor , corner room and what an awesome room it was . we were staring right at the hancock building and lake michigan . for those of you planning a visit to the american girl store , you will be happy to know , it is half a block away and within view of the hotel . the beds were comfortable and not too small . the bathroom was very nice , updated and clean . the shower was a bit finicky but that is to be expected in an older building . and the room did have a slight musty odor upon arrival but that went away after a few hours - again , older building . the hotel staff was courteous and attentive . they were more than happy to point us in the direction of cheaper parking rather than pay for valet - they do not have a parking lot on site . there are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area as it is just off of michigan avenue . i would definitely stay there again . 
overall this hotel is nice . i agree with the previous reviewer who said the rooms are too dark to work . the rooms have no overhead lighting outside the bathroom and have just one lamp that is supposed to light the whole room , but does a poor job . there are three other lamps- one on the desk and two by the bed , but they are primarily made for reading , not illuminating the room . the exercise room was good , the staff was friendly . overall it was a fine hotel . my one gripe is with the room i was first given . it was room N . i ' m giving this just to warn others in case you get this room . there are very few rooms on the Nth floor , so i ' m betting the problem is with all of them . initially , i noticed that the room had two big spotlights outside the window that are used to illuminate the top of the building . i ' m sure it looks cool from outside , but it will force you to close those blinds ( therefore robbing you of your view ) because they are quite bright . not a huge deal- i just closed the blinds . the second problem i noticed was a banging noise that happened every minute or so . i ' m a sound sleeper , so didn ' t think it would bother me . but every N minutes or so there was a much louder bang rattling noise . it was loud enough to make me jump each time it happened . the first time i thought someone was breaking down the door to my room . i think it must have been noise from the mechanical room , which i noticed was also on the Nth floor . not being one to cause a fuss , i decided to try and deal with it . well , by Nam i was wide awake in my bed awaiting the next jarring bang ! i finally gave up and called the front desk around Nam and they were nice enough to give me another room . not sure what i would have done had the hotel been sold out because i could not have gotten a good night sleep with that noise . i can ' t imagine i ' m the only person who has had this experience with this room unless this was a temporary problem within their hotel . so my gripe here is that they put anyone in that room at all considering N of the population would have a very difficult time sleeping through the noise . so overall i ' d say it ' s a fine hotel as long as you don ' t stay on the Nth floor . or if you happen to notice a loud noise in your room , change rooms immediately . don ' t wait around hoping the noise will stop like i did . 
we stayed at the knickerbocker hotel from jun N-july N N . my first mistake was purchasing this hotel stay through hotwire , which i will never use their service again . don ' t get stuck at a place you can ' t get your money back . my second mistake was actually staying there . i can ' t believe they consider this hotel a N star hotel . whoever rated this hotel as such must have been drinking and smoking something . this is a solid N-star hotel . the rooms are extremely small and not well maintained . it ' s an old hotel so there is layer upon layer of paint on the walls and molding . at first we had a room with a queen bed , which gave us about N feet on each side . the bathroom door could touch the bed . only one person can fit in the bathroom . there is no place to put your toiletries because it ' s a single sink . the wallpaper was peeling in various places . then we moved to a room with a king bed . that was a little better a little more room . the decor was horrible . it looked as if they picked up the items from a flea market . now , the location is great . it ' s a N N block from michigan ave . , which was a plus . but , i do not recommend this hotel or hotwire . 
location was great for me , as my son lives around the corner ! nice little neighborhood area , lots of pubs , restaurants , theatre district nearby . i was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews , and our initial reception wasn ' t very friendly , as we waited for over N minutes for valet parking . couldn ' t seem to get anyone ' s attention to leave the car . but adter that , it was a very nice experience and i will stay there again . concierges were super , room was lovely and well-appointed . only complaint about room was the feather pillows- i don ' t like them , asked for firmer pillow , but the maid brought more puffly pillows . bring your own if you like a firmer one ! but the bed was very firm , super comfortable . cool-lloking lobby , friendly staff , good value for the price . i ' ll stay again for sure . 
september N , N this was the first time i was in chicago . this was a very good experience . we got there before check in and they let us get into the room early . if we weren ' t able to they would allow you to store your luggage in a locked room before and after check out . the room was clean . the beds were comfortable . it has a large screen tv with hbo . the bathroom had a coffee pot , coffee , cream , sugar and cups . the ice machine was close by with reasonable priced pop . the closet had a iron and ironing board . it also stated that if you didn ' t remember to bring you razor , toothbrush , toothpaste etc . . they could provide it for you . the pool and whirlpool was inside and clean and with towels . the free breakfast was outstanding . it had homemade waffles , scrambled eggs , bacon , sausage , muffins , bagels , yogurt , fruit , coffee , cereal , tea and juices . the shower head had many settings and they provided shampoo and soap . it had a desk and chair in the room with free internet hookup . i was also very impressed on how nice the workers treated you . i felt it was necessary to let someone know . pros swimming pool , whirl pool , free awesome breakfast cons couldn ' t stay longer ! 
first , we chose the doubletree for and extended chicago weekend because we wanted to be close to public transportation , and to the downtown area . in addition we were confident that the doubletree brand would not have any unwanted surprises . we were not surprised ! the hotel is located a few blocks from the chicago river and the boat rides and a few blocks from navy pier . the concierge was extremely helpful when we needed information on using public transport to oak park ( home of the flwright museum ) and the university of chicago ( home of the robie house ) . he pointed us to the grocery store two blocks away where we bought all day subway bus passes which proved invaluable . the room itself was comfortable and fairly spacious . no complaints here . the only downside , as is often the case with higher-priced hotels , is that in-room wifi is N a day although its free in the hotel lobby . on the first day , the service kept cutting out , and , on check out , i mentioned this to the front desk and was immediately credited ! the view from our room was great and the lake is visible from most floors . there is an einstein bagel store in the lobby which proved immensely popular in the morning . be prepared for a bit of wait . one morning we ventured in the hotel restaurant for a typical , over-priced , breakfast . while seated , we could not help but notice the frequent arrival of natives chicagoans , across the street in a place called the west egg cafe . the line soon went out the door . we tried it the next day , and are delighted to report it was twice as good and half as expensive as the hotel ! don ' t miss this place for breakfast . all in all , a good choice . 
i stayed here for a conference in late april N . i liked the view from the hotel ( river view from the room , but a fabulous lake view from the elevator area ) . the hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky , and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy . one of my colleagues had to ask to get his room moved at N am due to the noise of moving elevators . the beds were comfortable , and i liked having ihome to plug my ipod . while the lcd tv was nice , free channels did not contain any hd broadcast , and we all know how painful it is to watch sd broadcaston a hdtv . they also charge to use the fitness center , which seems quite outrageous . i also paid for the wifi access . 
i have previously stayed at this hotel and enjoyed it . i stayed about four or five years ago for my birthday and was really impressed . i felt then that it was well managed and well maintained , which is difficult for a hotel of this size and capacity . this time around , i was also impressed overall ( although not very impressed by the rooms , somewhat dated , although nothing major , and they are fine given that you dont spend the bulk of your time in chicago in the room ) . the hotel itself seems very well maintained and has a lot of amenities ( business center , a few restaurants , bars , great location on the river , pool , parking ( although a rip off at N when you can go next door , literally , for N ) and nice views . overall , for the price in chicago i would rate this hotel pretty well , and it should be noted that i am pretty picky when it comes to hotels ! this hotel has a great fitness center overlooking the river ! the pool is okay , i never understand why hotels have pools and not hot tubs . . . this hotel does not have a hot tub , that would be a nice addition if they did . overall the hotel is nice , well kept and staff seemed friendly . the one complaint i have is that on a sunday morning starting pretty early around N or N am , the cleaning staff were being particularly loud in our hallway . i thought it was a group of hotel guests and was getting seriously annoyed , but was extremely surprised to find out that it was the cleaning crew that worked for the hotel . that was pretty irritating . the cleaning staff we did encounter were really nice , but might want to be a little more cognizant of the fact that guests want to relax and sleep in on vacation sometimes ! also , the tub in our bathroom did not work , it was stuck on the shower setting , and when i tried to run a bath , the tub spout almost came out of the wall ( i meant to tell front desk but did not get a chance ) might be time for an upgrade to the rooms sheraton , otherwise , well done hotel , especially such a large property ! lastly , i must mention , we ate sunday brunch in the hotel and it was seriously awesome , the chefs who made our omelets and crepes at the create your own bars were so enthusiastic and fun , and the food was great , a ton to offer . almost as good as the breakfast buffets on our honeymoon in bora bora , which is a major accolade for those of you who have never been to bora bora . nice work on the buffet . again have to say the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful here ! 
we held our annual user conference at the allerton hotel . the staff is attentive and the hotel seems to have low turnover as we see the same faces year-to-year . the food is excellent and the rooms are small but well appointed . 
the people were very friendly , rooms were comfortable , clean and of modern european style . the location is very good . i would have given it a N rating but for the following N . close to a busy hospital ( ambulance sirens at odd hours of the night ) . N . one of the elevators was not working when i checked in on a sat until i left on a tues . had to use the freight elevator both times . N . had a smoke alarm battery beep at N a . m . ( just as i was falling back to sleep after an ambulance siren woke me up ) . the front desk did not have replacement batteries but she did come up to remove the unit so i could get some sleep . i would recommend this place if you are not a light sleeper . 
this is our second stay at this hotel . the location is perfect for anything you want to do in downtown chicago . the staff are all very friendly , the rooms clean and very secure . the complimentary breakfast is far more than just a danish and coffee . . . there was a nice selection of fresh fruit , yogurt , cereal , fresh waffles and beverages . the dining area was very clean . the complimentary high-speed wireless internet was a nice bonus . we will certainly be back ! 
we stayed at the hyatt for six days . their service was efficient and courteous . the room was new and clean . it was spacious and had two double beds . the room looked just like the picture of a double bed room on the hotel ' s website . we enjoyed a comfortable stay . no complaints ! the fan in the bathroom was running all night long and was noisy . i did not bring the problem to the attention of the hotel . the following nights , i simply closed the bathroom door so i won ' t hear the on going noise from the bathroom fan . the fan kept the bathroom dry . no moisture or fogged up mirror . the sleep quality rating i gave had to do with the fan noise . 
have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted . great bar ( draught stella and guinness ) which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there , good food , lovely staff , large clean rooms , comfortable beds , spot on location for the golden mile , joey ' s pizzas next door are fantastic . ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please . highly recommended
i was a little hesitant to book a room here after reading the reviews , but decided that the location would make up for any problems . a year ago i stayed downtown and was very unimpressed with one of the five stars . the reception i received was very nice . the staff at the desk were very helpful and answered all of my many questions pleasantly . they even did some investigation for me when i asked about a specific church ( where my parents were married N years ago ) . my blind father and i were given a rather nice room , and the bathroom was huge ! we had a small coffee maker and a refrigerator . the room was clean . the decor is definitely old , but charming . the beds were comfortable and clean . i was very pleased not to have feathers in the room ( allergy which i made note of on my reservation ) . we had many channels on the tv to choose from . we did not need to use the window air conditioner . breakfast was free . . . and , considering , not bad . it is a self-serve style buffet . if you want eggs , bacon , waffles , etc . , they were available , but you had to microwave them yourself . bagels , muffins , donuts , cereal , coffee , tea , juices , etc . were all there for you . the breakfast room was very pleasant and clean . the attending staff were pleasant . i accidentally dropped a whole cup of juice . . . they rushed over to clean up my spill and just would not hear of it when i tried to clean it up myself . fresh fruit was available in the lobby N hours day , along with coffee and tea . cookies were available in the afternoon . internet access was available . . . free connection in the lobby , a free computer also available . i don ' t understand why internet access in the rooms incurred a charge . all staff were aware that my dad was blind , and they were very kind and helpful when he was navigating the hotel alone . parking was right outside the lobby door , and a back-up garage was available if the parking lot was full . i did not need to use the garage . sadly , this hotel is scheduled for demolition in three or four years and will probably be replaced with something outrageously expensive . overall , this hotel was just what we needed . not fancy , but nice people , clean surroundings , safe , and in an excellent location . 
we come to chicago once a year for a romantic get away . the talbott is our favorite hotel so far . you get the same amenities as " bigger names " , but with a price that is very reasonable and a cozier atmosphere . location is great , staff helpful and friendly . i personally love a smaller hotel that is quaint and high quality . highly recommend for those looking for the same . 
room very comfortable ( esp . after long flight ) . reception staff most helpful to N strangers to chicago , and breakfast bar excellent . easy walking distance or public transport to everywhere we wanted to go . 
stayed here on a travelzoo deal and during the taste of chicago . we came from mi city on the south shore train as to save on parking fees , which the station is about N blocks away . the el train system is also very close N-N blocks to several stations . very good location for our use . N block from the river , our room had river views out N sets of windows . also a good view of the new trump tower and the intesection of michigan ave and wacker . the room was about as big as you get in chicago , with new stuff in all the right places , N tvs and a washer and dryer . . no frills but very nice and not up tight . only complants was the tv in the bedroom only got N channels , but whos watching tv in the bedroom in downtown chicago anyways , and also N of the N elevators didnt work for the first N hrs we were there , causing a wait sometimes . would stay and recommend for the average person not looking for N star service but wanting a N star room . 
great location , very clean , and helpful staff . what more can i say ? 
stayed there for a tradeshow . hotel lobby looks more like an airport or factory . i don ' t know if all the rooms were as terrible as in the east tower , but i asked N times for another room and N times i got the same poor quality the rooms are very old ( old carpet , yellow curtains , dirty windows ) and the bathroom hasn ' t been upgraded since a long time . although the view ( on the lake ) was great , the rest was just horrible the doors have an opening of around N cm ' s between door and carpet ( no need to say you have the impression to sleep in the corridor ) and the old airco systems had to be turned down because of the noice . the breakfast room ( hall ) is not cozy , the bar is nice but expensive . i ' ll never go back ! ! ! ! ! 
others have made most of the points , so i won ' t belabor it . . . but when i walked in ( wearing dress shirt , sweater , and khakis ) at Npm on a weeknight there was some sniffing that i wasn ' t dressed properly . nothing wrong with this hotel , but nothing to blow me away . and the snobbishness is unnecessary . my room had a lovely view of another indistinguished building N feet away , which isn ' t the worst i ' ve had , but was hoping for a better view given the building height . 
great hotel in heart of chicago for business or pleasure . rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large . flat screen tvs , marble baths , all rooms are suites , great desk , kitchenette , comfortable bed , free wireless internet . . . everything you could ask for . location is easy walk to magnificient mile and lots of great restaurants . staff is friendly and helpful . short cab ride to loop . 
arrived at the westin and was treated to a beautiful room with a view of michigan avenue . service was great and the location could not have been better - it is steps away from world class shopping , dining and many architectural gems . while all staff members were gracious and helpful , ashley stood out . she was so focused on helping making the most of my visit she referred my companions and me to a an absolutely wonderful restaurant . she also arranged for a slightly later check out which really helped me out and saved me time . the room and bed were very comfortable . thanks to everyone at the westin for making this trip so delightful . 
i can ' t say enough good things about this hotel ! we were lost in the parking lot and a very kind man pointed us the way out . he was the manager off duty ! a very sweet maid greeted us on the way to our room . the room was very nicely decorated and very quiet . at breakfast the next morning the room was packed but the staff was so quick and friendly the tables were ready right away . i would stay here again ! 
the hotel staff at front desk was super , the only reason why i did not lower the score more . xavier , was pleasant cordial both days . the lobby with the big pumpkins . . . lovely . they offer free breakfast , but i didn ' t try it . it is a close enough walk to magnificent mile , close enough walk to the gold coast , and wacker drive . down side , the little guy with the glasses the worked in the bar , i observed him being rude snotty to everyone . poor customer relations . my room , it was big , roomy , the living room area was nice , however the bathroom . . . uuhh the tub needed to be recoated , the toilet paper holder was stuck in a hole in a wall , with a piece of soap wrapper to keep it place , the view . . . a parking garage and i guess dumpsters . oh and if you need to go to the airport in the morning . . . . contact a sedan car service ! ! ! ! the under N miles to chicago o ' hare took N hour N minutes . . . and that is after the actual N minutes it took to get a cab to agree to take us , they would stop and ask , " airport ? " we say yes and they just drive off , really ? i was afraid i was going to miss my flight . we had to hide our luggage behind the planters for the cabs to even pull over . the nice door guy tried so hard too ! so what happened ? i arrived at the airport ( i was checked in online ) slightly under the N minutes to drop off my one checked bag , so i had to reschedule my flight to N Npm or beg to see if my bag would make it then hustle to my gate . i have been to chi N times . it is a lot of work and nothing to do but eat , shop , and go to museums . just be prepared . . . it is not as simple as nyc or la . imo
i arrived by taxi from the airport very late at night . the reservation was ok , check in without problems . the suite was perfect place to stay and work , good light , very comfortable bed and enough space for me . the small kitchenette worked well , restaurant offerred all i needed and the location is great for all downtown access . highly recommend to use this hotel . 
this was the Nnd best hotel i ' ve stayed in in chicago ( only Nnd to the hilton towers south michigan ave ) . prior to arrival i emailed the room coordinator and requested a two bed two bath non somking room and was granted my request within an hour ! no problems even thought we got the room for only N through priceline . this is a huge bargain rooms usually begin at just under N and can go up to N . all of the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and helpful . they never passed us by without saying hello . the lobby is magnificent and the hotel is located in an ideal location in the loop . just a N . N cab ride from union station . the room was exceptionally clean . the hilton beds are extremely comfortable . the wall paper in the bathroom was quite outdated but goes with the theme of the older hotel . the only other draw back was the bathroom mirror is small but we had two bathrooms so we had no problem getting ready in the morning , we were sad to have to leave the palmer and can ' t wait to go back . 
let me say up front that the swanky , loud , disco lobby was way not for us . much to much going on there , lobby restaurant was average at the very best . but , but . we got a great rate and our , room , bed and bathroom were among the very finest that we have ever stayed in . the bed was supercomfortable , the bathroom was spa like . in general the room had a feeling of relaxed elegance . we would stay here again despite the disco lobby . housekeeping satff was awesome . 
there was a group of N that travelled to chicago recently and spent N nights at the allegro . we all loved it from the friendly service when we checked in to the very helpful concierge . the rooms were small but fine . the location was perfect . we walked to the magnificent mile . . . to the sears tower and took a boat tour on the chicago river . i would definitely go back to the allegro . . . they also had a wine hour every night . very enjoyable trip . 
if you take a trip to chicago , definitely consider staying here . i have stayed in various hotels throughout chicago over N years and this was my favorite hotel because of the staff , location , and overall value . below are the highlights staff -- extremely helpful and knowledgeable . it ' s been a year since i regularly stayed in this hotel and the doorman remembered who i was . the front desk staff was efficient and courteous . we were flying in to meet family and friends so i just found danita ' s email and asked for her help . she was amazing and professional throughout the entire process . in a hotel with a thousand rooms she provided bed and breakfast quality attention . location -- perfect location to easily get around chicago . walking distance to some of our favorite restaurants ( volare , quartino , west egg cafe , yolk ) , navy pier , michigan avenue , and even a free shuttle bus to a casino ! rooms facility -- the beds were very comfortable and even better than i remember . they had just replaced them when i was leaving . the bars and restaurants in the hotel are convenient . 
we booked the american girl package . our cost for N nights for N double beds was over N dollars . our room was supposed to be upgraded , but did not seem that terrific to me . the beds were comfortable , the room was small and outdated . the bathroom was in need of a remodel . the room was a really standard room . there is an expensive mini bar , took some things out , to put some of my things in , ( then put their things back before we left . --nothing perishable ) we did get valet parking included , and a fold out bed for the doll , which my daughter liked . she also got some cupcakes and milk . this hotel is in a great location , you can easily walk to michigan ave and the all important american girl store . there is a mcdonalds in easy walking distance if you have kids . if i was able to get this hotel for N dollars a night , i would take it . but not for what we paid . just too expensive for what you get . there are other hotels in the same area , would check them out first . my daughter did use the pool , the pool was nice , but the air temperature in the pool area was stifling hot , no air circulation , so unless you were in the pool it was uncomfortable . i am glad we got an opportunity to stay in this hotel . it was fun to stay in the city . 
we stayed at the crown plaza for two days . the location was great , right off of michigan street , close to everything . the room was great , the service was great . the only advice i can give is to make sure you read the note on the refrigerator , if you store your own food in it you will be charged a N . N fee . . 
this hotel is absolutely brilliant . only stayed here one night , but everything was spot on . they had a courtyard outside of the hotel so you could relax in the cool september air and soak in the " hustle and bustle " of chicago . it was great ! ! ! i would recommend this hotel to anyone needing a nice and upscale place to stay . it ' s worth it . 
lovely remodeled rooms with two comfy lounge chairs . no flat-screen , but i ' m sure that will come . very friendly and helpful staff . trendy , good restaurant . reasonable prices and walk to buddy guy ' s and jazz club . a little far from the north circle action , but on a quiet street and easy access to the el or busses . large room . twin sinks are nice . 
i have stayed here N nights . if you look for an inexpensive place at a central location , then this is the place for you . the room is your standard motel room ( i booked on their website paid only N night ) , if a bit outdated . parking is free , and while i was there ( thursday friday nights ) finding a free spot was never a problem . also , i didn ' t worry about safety , as the staff are watching closely who is entering the premises . . 
the palmer house is located in the city of chicago , il . the rooms here are all first rate-although prices are high there are times when you can get great deals-during holiday seasons , and other promotional deals . the lobby of this hotel is unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! just sitting at the bar having a drink is an incredible experience . at christmas and before , the famous christmas tree is put up-really puts you in the spirit . 
stayed here over labor day N . had free hotel points to use . great location right off magnificent mile . walking distance to navy pier as well ( half mile or so ) . there are better hotel options but it served its purpose . small rooms , and hotel has some age . small hotel bar in lobby and coffee shop connected . very small elevators so beware . nice balcony on upper floor with great views . have to walk a little ways for dinning options , none onsite . 
this hotel is by far one of our favorites in chicago . then again how couldn ' t it be . . . every time you walk in the door they offer you hot cookies ! it is fun , hip and luxurious without any pretense . the view from the rooftop bar is wonderful ! plus it ' s location right on state street is amazing ! don ' t think twice . . . stay there ! 
this is a great hotel with some amazing views of the lake and the river . of course , with the building boom in chicago , you also get a view into several construction sites , quite fascinating . the room has all you would expect from a business hotel and the bed is to die for ! ! ! but i don ' t believe it ' s worth the regularly advertized price . . . so be sure to hold out for discount rates . while we were there the elevators kept malfunctioning , often leaving people stranded on their floor during the moring check-out rush . i was also disappointed that their shower product bottles were not recyclable , indicating a serious lack of basic corporate environmental responsibility . 
we booked a room on the N ' th of may for one night at the avenue crowne plaza in downtown chicago . the reason we chose this hotel was that it was a special occasion for us and we wanted to stay in an excellent hotel and the reviews for your hotel were good . but once we checked in , we were very disappointed with the level of service provided to us . the receptionist who checked us in , a woman named arta , was very impolite and did not even have the courtesy to give us a smile . we had booked the room using a friend and family quote and she made us feel as if we had done something wrong by using a coupon provided by your hotel itself . after booking the rooms on the internet we had placed a request the the rooms be close to each other and preferable on a higher floor as it was our first time in chicago and we would have liked a nice view . when we checked in , arta said she did not receive any request and gave us what was available . when we went to see the rooms , we were very disappointed . one of the rooms ( N ) were still ok , but the other one ( N ) was much smaller , dirtier and had a broken fridge . we went down to the receptionist and when we told her we did not like the room , she gave us attitude and said " whats wrong with the room ? its a nice room . " she offered us another room but it turned out that it was a similar room on a floor that was much lower than our friends ' rooms . so we decided to stay in the original room , even though we were not comfortable there . we were highly disappointed with the overall experience , from check in to check out . we spent extra money because we wanted to stay in the crowne plaza and experience a different level of comfort but after this experience , i feel we would be better off staying in a days inn or a motel N that would have the same level of service but at least a lower price . 
as others have mentioned , the location can ' t be beat . we stayed three nights , june N-N . hotel has gone down a bit since i stayed last year ( june N ) . i am a priority club member but didn ' t really get anything from the intercontinental to show for it , not even a newspaper outside the door . had requested a room with a view and thought it would be fairly easy since it was the weekend . the room faced a construction site so most of our view was of the cranes outside . don ' t know why they couldn ' t have done better since hotel was not that crowded . they did put us in a king-size , as requested , but the very small room made it seem quite cramped . other minor annoyances included a bathroom exhaust fan that didn ' t work ( steam took forever to dissipate making shaving etc . next to impossible ) and toilet that wouldn ' t flush unless you held down handle for whole cycle . another minor peeve was the very strict instructions from the pool gym attendant to shower before using the pool . i have no problem with this , but the pool was filled with kids and during the times i was there i didn ' t see one of them ever leave to go use the bathroom , so you can only imagine ! hotel staff were polite but not particularly accommodating . at checkout , they noted it but weren ' t too concerned when i told them bathroom needed some maintenance . i will definitely look elsewhere next time i ' m in chicago . 
chicago is gorgeous and there are numerous great hotels . the best is the peninsula . the location is perfect , right off michigan and in the midst of everything . the entrance does not completely portray the beauty of the hotel , as you leave your luggage , and take the elevator to the lobby level . then , it begins--a beautiful arcade hallway , leading to the concierge and reception , with a continental restaurant serving three meals and afternoon tea and the best sunday brunch . they also had a talented three piece jazz band on saturday night . down a flight is a top chinese restaurant , and in the building is a french brasserie . the decorating is absolutely first rate , and then there are the rooms . we were fortunate to get their N for N deal , and also an upgrade to a suite , which included a complimentary mini cooper with driver . the bathrooms are large and perfect , there is a dressing room and closets and drawers , and the beds and furnishings are comfortable and lovely . my granddaughter began saic , which is the art school attached to the beautiful art museum down the street , and i also met with specialist doctors at northwestern medical down the street . simply , a great weekend at a truly great hotel . 
the hotel is really well located for exploring chicago being less than half a mile from the magnificent mile and millenium park . we stayed in a king spa room on the Nth floor which overlooked the river and didn ' t suffer from the noise issues other people have mentioned . the room was a good size with a huge bath tub and separate shower . the staff were really friendly and helpful . there are some negatives though . housekeeping was a bit hit and miss with basic things like toilet rolls not replaced and one day the room didn ' t get cleaned at all . you shouldnt have to phone up and remind them to do these things when you ' re paying over N a night . the room is pretty pricey so you would expect it to have everything you need . however , toiletries in the bathroom weren ' t enough for N people and there was no bath gel provided which , given the bath is the main reason why you ' d book the spa room , this seemed a bit tight . the hotel seemed to charge a lot for things other comparable hotels would provide for free such as web access and bottles of water . also , there ' s a N restocking charge for the mini bar even if you just take one item out of it . we ate in the hotel restaurant and the first time our waiter was brilliant , very accommodating and helpful . the second time however the service was poor with the waitress bringing out our main courses N mins after bringing out our starters and trying to cram them on the table , and forgot to pick up our drinks order from the bar so we had to fetch them ourselves . didnt eat there again after that . it ' s a great hotel but for the price there probably are better places to stay . 
i stayed here when i attended a conference in chicago . the location is hard to beat , and that ' s about all i can say about this hotel . amenities and service were almost non-existent . no breakfast ( no restaurant , even ) , no free in-room internet , no fitness facility ( for that you need to pay N day and walk three blocks to the doubletree ) . i couldn ' t even find an ice machine ! i had to go to the hotel bar for ice . the bartender begrudgingly fulfilled my request for a wineglass ( " once i give these out , they never come back . " ) there was supposedly a part-time concierge , but one never seemed to be at the desk . my bed was comfortable , and the room clean and basic . no complaints there . the air-conditioner , however , was horribly loud and cycled on and off every N minutes . i could not run it at night and sleep . the bathroom was ridiculously small , and the sink placed so that it partially blocked the doorway . there was also mold on the wall and ceiling . i didn ' t have any problems with the check-in staff , and i found the bellhops to be very helpful . all in all , i wouldn ' t stay here again . 
personal trainer sam great people skills and training skills concierge dianne and lisa very helpful , housekeeping lady very nice - complemented us on our room
i would definitely recommend hotelN . it was clean , rooms were spacious nice . staff was friendly , our room was cleaned daily no matter what time we left . didn ' t have to wait terribly long for elevators because there are N for bottom floors N for upper floors . the hotel is very centrally located . only thing i would have liked is to have a fridge and personal safe in room . also very happy with purchasing in advance through skoosh , got the room we were promised at a good price !
